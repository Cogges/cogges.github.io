The Gothic church of St James the Great in South Leigh is set to host its first music festival from Friday 4th July until Sunday 6 July.  Despite being only a mile from the A40, South Leigh is a beautiful, unspoilt village off the beaten track and the church is an ideal setting for a musical weekend.  

St James the Great is a 12th century church whose walls are adorned with wonderful medieval biblical murals and a Jacobean pulpit where John Wesley preached his first sermon in 1771.

The Friday night opens with New College School Choral Society’s performance of Vivaldi’s Gloria and a selection of summer music to set the scene. 
Saturday’s performance brings a touch of Andalucia to South Leigh with the moving flamenco guitarist [Rafael](http://www.flamencoguitarist.com).  His unique yet instantly recognizable sound moves flamenco into a new exciting era combining gypsy soul and energy with the earthiness of Andalucian chant.  He will be joined by percussionist Demi Garcia and dancer Jesus Olmedo.

The weekend’s festivities end with a Festival Evensong led by Revd Dr Erica Longfellow, Chaplain of New College Oxford.

Festival organiser Lianne Poyser said: “South Leigh is an idyllic setting for celebrating music and performance.  We are holding this event just for the pleasure of being able to bring some fantastic musicians and performers to the village as well as encourage visitors to South Leigh.”
