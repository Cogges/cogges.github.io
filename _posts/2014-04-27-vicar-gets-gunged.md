Rev Simon Kirby, Vicar of St Mary’s Cogges, Witney was gunged by his Parishioners on Sunday 27th April because they wanted to demonstrate their support.  This may seem an odd way to show it but the gunge-fest, where Simon ended up covered in green goo, marked the end of a day of fun and festivities to launch a fundraising campaign for improvements to the church site.  St Mary’s wants to revamp the entrance and expand the church hall.  The church has seen a big increase in attendance over recent years and needs more room for Sundays, improved facilities for the growing children’s work and space for hosting community events.

Simon said “It is a great privilege to be the Vicar of such a vibrant community and we are in the fortunate position of needing more space. We are a friendly and welcoming church but want to improve that welcome by making the access to our site more inviting for people who pass by as well as those who attend church. Our church hall is often booked for pre-school, Sunday teaching and during the week for youth clubs, and other functions.  Our plan is to improve and expand these facilities in order to do more.

“The Church Centre development is going to require significant fundraising and I felt that it was only right that I should kick off the proceedings by trying to raise some money myself. I told the Church that I was prepared to be gunged if we raised £500 on the launch Sunday and I was delighted at how enthusiastically everyone embraced the challenge as we raised just over £1000!”
