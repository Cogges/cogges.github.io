<h2>Time to get out of the boat</h2>

<p><strong>
I don't know about you but the beginning of the school term is always a 
challenging time of the year for me. I work on 'school term time' and this 
seems like the beginning of the year for me. It's a time when I set new 
goals and dream the odd dream or two without ever really having the guts 
to carry them through. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
A book that I'm reading quotes these words from Theodore Roosevelt which 
have certainly challenged me to believe my hopes and dreams are truly 
achievable. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
"It's not the critic who counts; not the person who points out how the 
strong stumble, or where the doer of deeds could have done better. The 
credit belongs to the person who is actually in the arena ... who, at 
best, knows in the end the triumph of great achievement, and who, at 
worst, if they fail, at least fails while daring greatly. So that their 
place will never be with those cold timid souls who know neither victory 
nor defeat." 
</strong></p><p>
I suspect Peter, friend of Jesus, would have appreciated Roosevelt's 
words -- after all, he encapsulated them! Remember his unforgettable 
walk -- on water! Put yourself in Peter's position for a moment. The 
boat is small, the waves are violent, even a seasoned professional 
like Peter is struggling to stand upright. Two choices -- stay in the 
boat, get out and walk towards Jesus -- no choice -- stay in the boat! 
But here's the predicament -- if you don't get out of the boat you will 
never walk on the water . 
</p><p>
I believe there is something inherent -- Someone -- who tells us there 
is more to life than sitting in the boat trying to avoid failure.  Each 
of us were made with a divine intention, a divine appointment which 
requires us to leave the comfort of our routine existence and begin the 
adventure of finding out what life is really all about. 
</p><p>
What's stopping you? In other words, what is your boat?  What is it 
that provides you with safety and security when you feel most afraid? 
What do you put your trust in when life gets a little stormy?  Staying 
in the boat doesn't guarantee safety. 
</p><p>
My friend John Otrberg said, 
"You can live on bland food so as to avoid an ulcer, drink no tea, 
coffee or other stimulants in the name of health, go to bed early, stay 
away from night life, avoid all controversial subjects so as never to 
give offence, mind your own business, avoid involvement in other people's 
problems, spend money on only necessities and save all you can. You can 
still break your neck in the bath tub, and it will serve you right." 
</p><p>
I'm determined to take a few risks in the year ahead, to realise a few 
dreams and to make a few mistakes and the great thing about water-walking 
is that God helps us do what we know we could never do on our own!  
I pray that you too will have the courage to follow Peter's example, 
step out of the boat and seek the divine intention that has always been 
on God's heart for you. 
</p><p>
Happy sailing!
