<h2> Eggsperience Easter </h2>

<p>
Every  year children  look forward to eggs on Easter Day.  I can 
remember looking for mine in the garden.  Have you ever wondered 
why we eat eggs on Easter Day?  
</p>

<p>
The use of the egg as a Christian symbol goes back to the 4th century 
when eggs were forbidden during Lent.  The problem with this is that 
much of Lent usually falls during early Spring, the peak time for hens to 
lay eggs.  This led to the practice of hard boiling  eggs  during Lent   and   
decorating them as gifts  for   children  on  Easter  Day.    It  wasn't  until 
Victorian times that John Cadbury made his first chocolate egg.  The first 
creme egg dates from 1923.  Perhaps it was the lack of creme eggs that 
made Queen Victoria's life so unamusing!
</p>
<p>
The egg itself of course is a symbol of new life.  Spring is a  time for 
planting:  a time for new shoots, new life.  On Easter Day Jesus offers us 
precisely that - New Life.  It is an opportunity for the 'old seed' within to 
die and a 'new seed' to take shoot.  Jesus death on the cross and his 
resurrection on Easter Day offers us the opportunity of New Life in him.  
The resurrection is not the easiest thing to believe in, even the early 
disciples found it difficult but for those who take the trouble to investigate 
the events of Easter, the evidence is compelling.  Will you rise to the 
challenge of Easter Day?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Wishing you all a very Happy Easter</strong>
