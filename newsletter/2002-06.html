<h2>Christianity</h2>

<p>
Historically, Christianity has had a peculiar view on life.  It makes
no sense at all in practical terms (of course many would say that's
still the case!).  All the religions of the ancient world were about
success. They were identified with warrior peoples and empires and
military success.
</p>

<p>
Jesus's message upended all the received wisdom of the ages. It was the
poor God loved. The rich He would send away, empty, and the destitute
would inherit His kingdom. Weakness was strength, success failure.
Ultimate prizes would go to the meek and lowly.
</p>

<p>
We know this didn't go down well with the religious authorities of the
day and Jesus was put to the most horrific death. It seemed as
comprehensive a failure as you could find in all the annals of
history.  Yet, the movement of the powerless spread, despite all the
ruthless persecutions, and the civilised world became Christian. And
today there are 1800 million followers of Jesus Christ. Amazing! What
was it about this one man that so changed the world? It certainly
wasn't to do with coercion because only love can summon a true response
of love.
</p>

<p>
This was the message that the early followers of Christ carried with
them - that God's love for them was so unconditional, so boundless,
that in Jesus it called Him to pay the ultimate price. I remember
listening to a pretty awful sermon by a man I admired greatly - he was
Presbyterian, so it was not only dull, but long! Until, that is, he
began to read some verses from John's Gospel, chapter fifteen, "As the
Father has loved me, so I have loved you". And then he read them again
and again.
</p>

<p>
That's why the Christian Church grew so rapidly - because love, by its
very nature, is selfless and selflessness is what really appeals to
human nature.
</p>

<p>
The  Church in the twenty first century must face up to some very harsh
questions - none more so than this - does it demonstrate the selfless
love of Christ in the world?
</p>

<p>
If it did then we'd be caring for the sick, looking after the old folk
in our neighbourhood, many of whom have forgotten what a warm embrace
is. We'd be feeding the ophans, visiting the prisoners, spending
quaility time with our children - in a word, we'd be living as Jesus
did. This is penetrating love that makes a difference.
</p>

<p>
The Kingdom of God is about bringing light into dark places and that's
what we want to be about in St Mary's, our values are about
demonstrating God's love in practical ways, showing mercy because we
have been shown mercy, being obedient to what God has to say in the
Bible and serving YOU, selflessly in the our Parish.
</p>

<p>
Of course this should all work itself out in how we worship on Sundays.
I heard a story about a wee boy being shown around the Church by his
local Vicar and, in particular, be shown the memorials on the walls.
The Vicar says, "these are the names of people who died in the
services". The wee fella responds, "Did they die in the morning or
evening service?"
</p>

<p>
Abraham Lincoln once said, "If all the people who fell asleep in Church
on Sunday Morning were laid end to end......they would be a great deal
more comfortable!"
</p>

<p>
Our Sunday services ought to be an expression of God's love for us and
our love for Him and all that we do must be honouring to Him. It's my
desire to develop the best of the old and the new in what we're about
on Sundays in St Mary's and I would warmly invite you to come and meet
with us. Or, if that's too big a step for you, then telephone me and
[if you live in the neighbourhood] I'll be only too pleased to pop 
round and say hello.
