<h2> It's just not cricket! </h2>

<p>
I write this, my last article in the Cogges Parish Newsletter, with
a mixture of excitment and sadness. Excitement, because God is
taking my wife and me on to a new sphere of ministry in Exeter;
sadness, because we are saying goodbye to people and a place we
have loved very much over the last eleven years. It was in this
community that we saw our eldest daughter married, and where our
youngest daughter was born and baptised (as it happened, all in the
same year!). We have shared in the work of the gospel, in both joy
and sorrow with the people of St Mary's and the Blake Church at
Cogges, and St James, South Leigh. It has been good to have been
here.
</p>

<p>
Preparing for the move is a powerful reminder of this time eleven
years ago, when we first moved into the Priory. We arrived in late
July, and spent the first few weeks in residence enjoying our
summer holidays. In the midst of carpet laying and curtain hanging,
there was time to watch cricket on television. My abiding memory is
of seeing Graham Gooch, in the first Test against India at Lord's,
scoring 333 runs in the first innings, and 123 in the second,
ensuring England's resounding victory. It was a marvellous match,
and you had to feel a little sorry for Alan Lamb and Robin Smith,
both of whom also scored centuries which were rather overshadowed
by their captain's brilliant performance. It makes a sad contrast
to the lacklustre performance England are putting on in the current
one-day international series with Australia and Pakistan.
</p>

<p>
There is also a sharp contrast between those heady and brilliant
days and today's troubled times for international cricket. The
former South African captain, Hansie Cronje has been banned from
the game after being found guilty of taking part in match-fixing,
and suspicion and allegations continue to sully the name of a game
which was once a byword for honesty and fair play. You can almost
hear the mandarins of the Long Room at Lord's spluttering "I say,
it's just not cricket!"
</p>

<p>
It shows that no part of human life is exempt from human corruption
and greed. What the Bible calls "sin" is a pervasive force. Even
cricket, that bastion of solid virtues, can be spoilt by it. Even
God's creation, which its Creator described at the very beginning
as "very good" can be, and has been sullied by it.
</p>

<p>
That's the bad news. But there is good news, too.  The Bible puts
it like this: "But God demonstrates his own love for us in this:
While we were still sinners, Christ died for us." (Romans 5:8). It
has been my privilege over these last eleven years to preach and
encourage the people of Cogges and South Leigh with this very
special good news. No matter what failure and disgrace we fall
into, there is a place to which we can go to find absolute
forgiveness and restoration. Jesus died on the cross to win that
gift for us. All we have to do to receive it is to believe and ask.
Although I am sad to be leaving, I am confident that I leave behind
three churches which know and proclaim this greatest of all truths.
My prayer is that some who are reading this newsletter will accept
the gift that Jesus Christ holds out to you today.
</p>

<p>
In a few weeks time, the Bessent family will be on holiday from
work, and settling into Alphington Rectory. Once again, in the
midst of carpet laying and curtain hanging, I hope there will be
time to watch cricket on television. This time, it's the Ashes. I
would like to think that someone like Graham Thorpe or Marcus
Trescothick will follow in the footsteps of Gooch and hit a huge
score against the Aussies. We shall see!
</p>

<p>
May God bless you all.
