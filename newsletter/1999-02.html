The largest grossing film ever released is about one of the biggest
maritime disasters of all time: <EM>The Titanic</EM>.  By now you will
probably have seen the film, watched the video (at least twice) and be
totally familiar with the plot.  One minute all is plain sailing,
especially for those in first class, then along comes this
iceberg...<P>

Suddenly all the passengers of whatever class, gender or age are
absolutely certain that they need one thing in this life, and they need
it now: <STRONG>saving</STRONG>.  People do not approach the lifeboat
and argue with other passengers about whether or not the iceberg truly
exists or if there is a better lifeboat.  <EM>To the drowning
passengers of a sinking ship salvation does not need to be explained,
only offered and quickly!</EM> <P>

A thousand or more people aboard the Titanic needed saving.  Perhaps a
few hundred thousand need saving from having to watch the Titanic video
a third time!<P>

But how comfortable are you with the idea that you, me, your neighbours
and friends and even the vicar and the Archbishop of Canterbury need
saving too?  Saving from sin and its consequence - death.<P>

It is hard to think of a less fashionable word to the modern ear than
sin.  For most people sin is most often associated with "old-fashioned"
phrases such as "living in sin" or "miserable sinner".  Oh and
"irrelevant" Christians too.<P>

Let us be clear that for believers sin is literally deadly.  Sin is
something that offends the very nature of God.  Square this circle.
How can a perfect holy God tolerate one small tiny insignificant sin in
His creation without compromising His perfection?  One drop of ink, no
matter how minute, makes a blank piece of paper no longer spotless.<P>

For Christians, sin is about being disobedient to God, and doing less
than His perfect will.  Everyone blots their copy book at some point in
their lives.  Surely this makes it impossible for anyone to enter God's
holy presence (heaven) without spoiling perfection?<P>

Just when things are looking hopeless, God squares the circle for us by
sending His only Son, Jesus Christ, into the world to put right all the
hateful and hurtful things ever done.  Jesus died for you and for me
and when Christians say <EM>Jesus Christ came down from heaven for us
<STRONG>and our salvation</STRONG></EM>, we mean:
<OL>
<LI>God took on flesh (became incarnate) and entered into our world as
    an ordinary human.
<LI>He did so to mount a rescue mission to save us all from drowning in
    our sins.  All of us.  Men, women, children; 1st, 2nd and third
    class; good people and less good people:  Everyone.
<LI>The rescue mission involved living a perfect life in total
    obedience to God including submitting to a horrible and humiliating
    death on a cross.
</OL><P>

Why did God take such drastic steps to offer us the eternal lifeline of
salvation?  If sin and the consequences of sin are so trivial, why did
God send His only Son into the world to die so painfully?  If there
were any other way, we can be sure God would have found it.<P>

We do not work our way to heaven.  Salvation is a gift, freely given to
those who believe in Jesus Christ.<P>
