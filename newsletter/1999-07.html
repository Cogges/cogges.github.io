<STRONG>
Our lives on this earth are often described as a journey.  Each
of us travels through time and space and, as we travel, other 
travellers join us and then depart from us.  Today, it seems, the
speed of our journey through life is accelerating.  Certainly we find
it hard to believe that our curacy here at Cogges and South Leigh is
now coming to an end and that as we move on in August it will be
exactly three years since we moved to Witney.</STRONG><P>

<STRONG>
We knew when we arrived that this part of our journey would be
short - it's part of this job.  But that doesn't make leaving any easier.
Although we knew hardly anyone here when we moved from Durham
we've always been made most welcome by the churches and the parish.
As a result, we've really enjoyed our time here and Witney has
become our home.
</STRONG><P>

We're excited by our new jobs in Oxford but they will be quite
different - Lis will be working mainly with students in Jesus College,
Andrew will be teaching and helping train people to be vicars.  We
will miss parish life and being part of a parish community.
