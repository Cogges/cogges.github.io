<h2><em>God</em> won't let go...</h2>

<p><strong>
It's funny how life is governed by terms when you have school age
children, and as I prepare for this new term I do so with a sense of
anticipation.
What challenges will I face? What will test my faith? What projects
will I complete and which ones will lie unfinished?
</strong></p><p><strong>
I'm sure, for most of us, life is little different -- there are
mountains to climb, important projects to complete.
</strong></p><p><strong>
There's a wonderful
passage of scripture that
I turn back to again and
again when I'm finding
life a struggle and yet I
know I must push on:
</strong></p>
<blockquote><strong><em>
Even youths will faint and be weary,<br>
And the young will fall exhausted;<br>
But those who wait for the LORD<br>
Shall renew their strength, They shall
mount up with wings like eagles, They shall run
and not be weary, They shall walk and not faint.
</em></strong><br>
Isaiah 40:30-31
</blockquote>
<p>
Those words, 'soaring,
running, walking' hold
great promise for us.
Isaiah is saying that
those who wait on the
Lord will sometimes
'soar' -- they will know
of His strength enabling
them to achieve great
things. Sometimes we
will be able to 'run' and
not grow weary -- even
when times are hard,
if we persist with great
determination, we will
complete the task or
finish the project and rest
confident in a job well
done.
</p><p>
Some days though we
will not be soaring, and
we cannot run. In those
times all we can do is
walk and not faint. All we
can say is, "God, I'll hang
on. I won't let go. I'll wait
for your strength. I'll just
keep on walking".
</p><p>
Experience tells me that
we must keep walking.
What we wait for is not
more important than
what happens to us while
we are waiting. It is just a
matter of time.
</p><p>
I pray that whatever
Autumn holds for you,
you'll be able to hold on
to this great promise from
God. Let me leave you
with one final promise
from Psalm 27:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
Wait for the LORD;<br>
Be strong, and let your heart take courage;<br>
Wait for the LORD!
</em></blockquote>
