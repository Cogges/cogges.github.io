<h2>Lazy Days</h2>

<p><strong>
As I write this I am enjoying a summer's evening in my garden, listening 
to the birds, and this being Cogges, the sound of the A40 in the background 
too.  The lazy days of summer (if you are Iucky enough to be lazy) are upon 
us and it gives us time to reflect.
</strong></p><p><strong>
I am reminded of a meal out I once had with a friend.  We made the mistake of 
going to the pub that wasn't busy, thinking we might be served more quickly. 
We waited and waited and our meals finally arrived one hour after we had 
ordered them. The customer service was appalling.  A kind of Fawlty Towers 
without being funny. 
</strong></p><p>
In our working lives customer care is big business these days, with companies 
paying a fortune for consultants to train their staff. This made me think how 
well Jesus treated people, meeting them at their point of need with love and 
compassion. 
</p><p>
As a church we try to follow Jesus' example.  Sometimes we get it right, but 
I am also aware that too often we get it wrong. For when we have got it 
wrong, please forgive us. 
</p><p>
To go back to my first thought, Summer is always a good time to take stock of 
our lives and reflect.  There is no better example of life to reflect on than 
Jesus himself.
