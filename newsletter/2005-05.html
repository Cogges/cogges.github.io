<h2>Moving on</h2>

<p><strong>
Life has often been described as a journey and over the last 5 years
it has been my privilege to journey with you in Cogges.  In that time I
have shared in many times of great joy and in times of sadness too.  I
have met so many people from all walks of life. It is of course the
special occasions that stand out most; baptisms, weddings and those
festival occasions.  It has been so good to see the church full of
children at Christmas and other times too.  The Cogges Seniors Panto was
unforgettable.  It has been good to see the church's links with Blake
School and the Cogges Manor Farm Museum grow as this is so healthy for
our community.
</strong></p>

<p><strong>
Sad that it is for me to go, I shall be leaving on the 1st May to go
on my travels. In July I shall be going to Kandersteg in Switzerland
to be Chaplain to an International Scout Camp. I shall also be
travelling to Canada and New Zealand, exciting times ahead.
</strong></p>

<p>
At this Eastertide I am reminded of Jesus greeting to the disciples
when they were feeling insecure and upset... Jesus appeared amongst
them and said, "Peace be with you!". In these uncertain times it is
good to be reminded that Jesus comes to bring us a deep peace within
our hearts and is able to release us from all that holds us back. 
Yes he can actually do it!
</p>

<p>
I can do no better than to wish you all well and pass on our Lord's 
greeting,"Peace be with you."
