Anyone who has seen the film <EM>Apollo 13</EM> or who can actually
remember that ill-fated space flight will be familiar with those words,
the first indication to a watching world that something had gone wrong
on board the craft.  Like many other phrases spoken by the famous at
critical moments (for example, "there can be no white-wash at the White
House") it has passed into the language;  it is often used by people
who are frustrated that modern technology doesn't do what it's supposed
to - in my case, when the computer decides to crash!<P>

The story of Apollo 13 is one of heroism and ingenuity.  "We have a
problem" was a masterful piece of understatement;  in fact, they had a
potential catastrophe on their hands.  The journey to the moon
abandoned, the mission had a new priority, to return the occupants of
the crippled space craft safely to earth.  Although I have seen the
feature film, my most vivid memory of the event was the live BBC
coverage of the capsule's re-entry into earth's atmosphere.  For
several minutes there was a radio black-out, and no-one on earth knew
whether the craft was safe, or had been burnt up by the intense heat of
re-entry.  The studio presenters (including Patrick Moore, I seem to
remember) were literally on the edge of their seats with anxiety during
those minutes.  And when the silence was finally broken by the voice of
the astronauts announcing their safe arrival, the sheer relief and joy
in that studio was overwhelming.<P>

"We have a problem."<P>

The Bible has a similar point to make to us.  Not a breakdown of space
technology, but of moral and spiritual integrity.  Not a problem
affecting just three men out in space, but affecting the whole human
race.  Not a life-threatening separation from our home planet, but an
eternal separation from our God.  And the problem?  "All have sinned
and fall short of the glory of God." (Romans 3:23).<P>

Easter is a time of year when we celebrate again the heroism of Jesus
Christ, the Son of God.  His was the rescue mission that saved us.  His
death on the cross paid the penalty for our sins.  His resurrection to
life on the third day declared that all his life and mission had been
true and from God.<P>

We have a problem.<P>

But it doesn't have to be.  Jesus Christ is alive and available to all
those who turn to him.  We shall be worshipping him and celebrating his
work for us this Easter.  You are most welcome to come and share with
us.<P>
