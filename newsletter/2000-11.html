I have always had a soft spot for the film <em>Ben Hur</em>.  I
guess it's partly because of the sheer spectacle (all those
galley slaves rowing their socks off, not to mention that
chariot race!), and partly because of the haunting musical
score by Miklos Rosza.  Perhaps there's even a bit of
curiosity: they do say that if you look carefully, you will
see a red Ferrari intrude into one of the scenes of the
ancient Roman Empire. I have looked, and so far, I haven't
spotted so much as a Reliant Robin!
</p>

<p>
But I think the main reason I like the film is the way it
shows how Jesus Christ can bring forgiveness and healing
into our lives. Ben Hur is a man eaten up with hatred and
revenge. A local Roman official has been responsible for an
act of terrible cruelty which has devastated Ben Hur's
family. In response, he can only think of taking revenge.
His family has been destroyed, so he will destroy the
culprit in return.
</p>

<p>
Then, as the film draws to its climax, Ben Hur finds
himself standing at the foot of Jesus' cross. He watches
the Son of God suffering and dying; he hears him say
"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do."
And, as he later reports, "I felt his voice take the sword
out of my hand."  Forgiveness and reconciliation came into
his life, because of his encounter with the crucified
Jesus.
</p>

<p>
One Good Friday afternoon, the BBC screened <em>Ben Hur</em>. 
As I'm always in church at that time taking services, I set
the video recorder to tape it. Later that day, as I sat and
watched the recording, I was annoyed to find that at the
very climax of the film the BBC had chosen to splash news
flash captions across the screen. As I tried to watch Jesus
dying on the cross, the picture was hidden by a flash
telling us that a historic peace deal was being struck at
that very moment in Northern Ireland. And that caption came
up not once, but several times during the crucial last few
minutes of the film.  Suddenly, I stopped being annoyed. It
was an amazing piece of timing. The truth is, that if there
is to be real reconciliation and forgiveness between the
warring parties in Northern Ireland, it will be when all
sides repent and submit to Jesus, who died to bring
humanity back to God and into peace.
</p>

<p>
Two years on, we still wait for that to happen, and the
Good Friday Agreement seems a long way off.  But the cross
is still the hope for the province. As I write this,
another conflict is capturing the headlines. Israel, the
very place where Jesus lived, died and rose again, is the
scene of violence between Palestinian and Israeli. There
too, the hope for real peace lies in Jesus, the Prince of
Peace. He will not force the hand of nations and
governments, but where men and women turn to him, he will
bring his peace and forgiveness. What is true on a national
scale is true for individuals. Do you know the peace of
Jesus Christ in your heart?
