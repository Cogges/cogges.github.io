<p><strong>
I am writing this at the end of the second week of the bombing of
Afghanistan.  The burning question of the day is whether the bombing
should be halted in order to allow humanitarian aid to reach Afghan
refugees before the winter sets in.  The debate is between those who see
the rapid defeat of the Taliban military as offering the best way
forward for the suffering population of refugees, and those for whom
humanitarian concern takes priority over political and military
concerns.
</strong><br clear="all">
</p>

<p>
I wonder if it is as simple a choice as that.  I have often mused over a
peculiar sentence of St Paul's in his Letter to the Romans.  "If your
enemies are hungry, feed them; if they are thirsty, give them something
to drink; for by doing this you will heap burning coals on their
heads."  Here we are encouraged to do good, not out of compassion but
as an effective weapon against our enemies.
</p>

<p>
And if we think about it, it makes a good deal of sense.  Reports coming
out of Kandahar and Jalalabad suggest that the bombing is hardening
support for the Taliban.  That whereas a fortnight ago, the Afghan
government seemed on the brink of collapse, it is now stronger and more
resilient.
</p>

<p>
So perhaps we should stop the bombing and send in the food.  Not because
we seek to abandon legitimate military and political goals, but rather
that doing good may be a much more effective way of achieving them.
</p>

<p>
As Paul puts it "Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with
good".
