<h2>All good gifts around us..........</h2>

<p><strong>
Harvest is a time when we give thanks for God's provision for us.
Something here in England we have come to take for granted.  
Sometimes we notice a price increase in produce when a particular 
crop somewhere in the world is poor, but we have never experienced 
empty supermarket shelves on a large scale.  It is therefore the 
farmer who feels the pinch, for us it is just an inconvenience.
</strong></p><p><strong>
It was so good to see our harvest thanksgivings so well attended 
this year.  I know that many of you found our service in the Cogges 
Manor Farm Museum a joyful and moving experience.
</strong></p>

<p><strong>
HOPE FOR BURUNDI
</strong></p><p>
You may not know that for some years now St Mary's Cogges has had a link
with Burundi.  Many in Burundi struggle to survive.  Crops cannot be
guaranteed and the country has been torn apart by civil war.  Through a 
scheme run by Christian Aid we have been able to purchase around 200 goats 
to give to poor people in Burundi.  The goats provide milk to drink, much 
needed nourishment for children.  They also produce manure that can be 
used to help crops grow.
</p><p>
Needless to say goats produce more goats, the first 10 are returned to
Christian Aid's partners in Burundi to be given to another needy family.  
In this way a small gift is recycled and goes a long way.
</p><p>
The next time we sit down to a meal that we have prepared with readily
available produce, let us remember those who produce it for us and those 
elsewhere whose whole day is taken up with the search for food.  Let us 
be thankful for the plentiful provision we enjoy.
</p>

<h2>...then thank the Lord for all his love....</h2>
