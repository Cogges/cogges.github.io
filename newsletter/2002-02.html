<h2> DANGER!  GOD AT WORK! </h2>

<p>
To be honest, the church doesn't enjoy a particularly good public
image.  How many people have given up on the church because they have
found it messy and unattractive?  I wonder - what were their
expectations?
<br clear="all">
</p>

<p>
I've recently been involved in a small building alteration project,
stripping out an old bathroom that was well past its sell-by date and
creating something bright and new in its place.  It's amazing how much
mess even small-scale work causes: heaps of crumbled plaster, broken
tiles, bits of brick and wood, dust everywhere.  By the time you begin
putting things back together, there are holes in the walls, boards up
in the floor, pipes and wires sticking out, and building materials and
tools all around.
</p>

<p>
Then the work of reconstruction starts.  Yes - it's still noisy, it's
still messy.  But when it's done - the rubbish cleared away, everything
finished and cleaned, ready for use - it was well worth all the
upheaval.  All the noise and mess are forgotten, the old has gone, the
new has come.
</p>

<p>
The church is a bit like a building site.  The Bible talks of its
members as "living stones", with God as the builder.  None of us are
ideal building materials - we are dirty, with awkward corners - but God
is at work on us, washing us clean, building us on the firm foundation
of Jesus, squaring us to the truth of his gospel, building us plumb to
his righteousness, bonding us together with his love.  God still has
more to do with each of us, which at times can be painful.
</p>

<p>
So why put up with it all?  Is it worth it?  As far as I am concerned:
Yes! Yes! Yes!  In spite of the mess of the building process, it's good
to be part of, God is a great builder, and the finished result will be
absolutely amazing: "a radiant church, without any blemish... a
dwelling in which God lives by his Spirit."
</p>

<p>
God's building work is far from complete.  So not surprisingly it may
well seem messy and unattractive at present.  But one day, the upheaval
of building will be forgotten in the joy of completion.  The building
still needs more stones before the work is done.  Will you be one?
