<h2>Healing touch...</h2>

<p><em>
"Father Jan Lavric from Clayton, near Doncaster, had helped to
organise a pilgrimage to Rome for his Parish.  The highlight of the
trip was an audience with the Pope in the Vatican.  By the time
Father Lavric had seen to the needs of his party he was exhausted
and there was only one seat left -- a wheel chair!
</em></p><p><em>
No sooner had he sat down than a nun wheeled him off to be
blessed by the Pope.  Father Lavric had no chance to explain,
the Pope said words of blessing, then left the room.  As
Father Lavric got up from the wheel chair, to see to his party,
there was a tremendous commotion among the nuns 
and the rest, as they say, is history!"

Do you believe that people get healed and if you do 
why is it that some do get healed and some don't?

<p>
If you've ever been fortunate enough to sit in St Mary's church at
sunrise -- when it is possible to see the sun rise that is -- you
can't fail to notice the incandescent light stream through the stain
glass of the beautiful east window.  It holds your gaze for minutes
and it's only then that you begin to notice what the rich colour of
the glass is illustrating.  All three windows show Jesus healing
people with a touch of his hand -- truly inspiring.
</p><p>
In the time of Jesus those with disease would have been classed as
unclean and pushed to the margins of society, many having to leave
their homes and live outside their town.  To touch such as these would
have left that person unclean also.  But again and again Jesus acted
out of compassion -- with little regard for his own welfare he touched
those with leprosy and afflicted with blindness, not only bringing
physical restoration but allowing them to re-integrate into society.
</p><p>
The Gospel writers capture the healing ministry of Jesus in four
dimensions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The Spiritual -- He claimed that a restored relationship with 
    God was possible through Him.</li>
<li>The Psychological -- He claimed He had come to set the captives
    free -- to enable the personality to be fully integrated.</li>
<li>The Social -- meetings with Jesus often lead to restoration of
    relationships.</li>
<li>The Physical -- 25% of the Gospels record Jesus healing people
    physically.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Sadly, I am confronted with illness often in my job and have
experienced the impact cancer has on a family when my wife Cathy was
diagnosed with Hodgkin's Disease seven years ago.  It's really hard --
hard to watch someone you love suffer, hard to pray, hard to
understand when prayers don't lead to someone being healed.  But Jesus
urged his followers to pray for healing and this has been the church's
tradition through the centuries.
</p><p>
The local church at its best ought to bring comfort to the
broken-hearted and be committed in prayer for the sick -- at its best,
whatever the capacity for human suffering, the church should have the
capacity for healing and wholeness in all dimensions.
