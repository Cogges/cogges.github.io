<h2> WAITING </h2>

<p>
As essential road works have been carried out in Witney over this past
year, I have spent more time waiting in queues of traffic than I wish to
remember.  
</p>

<br clear="all">

<p>
Advent, the 4 weeks leading up to Christmas, is also a time
of waiting.  Unlike waiting in traffic however, Advent is a good reason
for waiting, a time of anticipation.  I can remember as a child opening
the doors on my Advent Calender each day and the temptation to have a
sneaky look behind the double doors on the 25th.  There were no
chocolates behind each door then, just a countdown to Christmas.  I can
also remember finding a few unwrapped presents before Christmas one
year; my initial excitement soon turned a little sour as I realised that
some of the excitement of Christmas had been lost.  Perhaps you have
some similar memories.
</p>

<p>
Today, of course, we can look back at Jesus' birth as an event that
changed history; but who was anticipating it?  Certainly not the
shepherds keeping watch over their flocks by night.  They were terrified
when the angel came to them, this was the last thing they were
expecting.  On the other hand, Isaiah, amongst others, foretold the
coming of the Messiah several centuries before.  Simeon, a devout Jew,
received a revelation from God that he would not die before Jesus was
born.  A week after the birth Simeon was able to hold the baby Jesus in
his arms.
</p>

<p>
Advent then is a time for waiting, as we prepare for Christmas.
However, for Christians, it is also a time of preparation for the second
coming of our Lord Jesus, when he comes in glory to judge all our
hearts.  Just like his birth in Bethlehem, some will be prepared and
waiting, others like the shepherds will be terrified.  So perhaps there
is more to waiting, than sitting in a traffic jam after all.
</p>

<p>
As you ponder all these things, may I, on behalf of Blake and St Mary's
Cogges, wish you all a very Joyful Christmas this year.
