<h2>Where is <em>God</em> when it hurts?</h2>

<p><strong>
Over the past few months we have all witnessed suffering on a scale
that is almost too difficult to imagine.  It began on Boxing Day with
overwhelming images of destruction, chaos and tragedy as the Tsunami
struck shores along the peninsulas of Asia.
</strong></p>

<p><strong>
Within what seems like days, those terrible images of suffering were
replaced by heart rending coverage of the 60th Anniversary of the
liberation of Auschwitz and other death camps.  The carnage and
brutality in Iraq are played out so regularly on our television 
screens that it is difficult not to become a little anaesthetized 
by them.
</strong></p>

<p>
Clever articles have been written and words of wisdom sought from 
the great and the good about why such disasters occur.  Neither are
Ministers, like myself, exempt from the pressure to produce rational
explanations and neat little packaged responses.  If truth be told
though, there is no easy answer to the problem of suffering -- maybe
no answer at all to the question of why natural disasters occur.
Theologians and philosophers have wrestled for centuries with the
problem of suffering and no one has ever come up with a simple and
complete solution.
</p>

<p>
One of the questions I'm asked most frequently is "Why does God 
allow suffering?" and without ducking the issue, I would prefer to
turn this question on its head and ask "Where is God when we suffer?"
-- not because I believe the former question is unimportant, but 
rather that history has proved suffering is inevitable and, at times,
we are powerless to change it.
</p>

<p>
Personal experience in the past five years has proved to me that when
suffering becomes personal there is little to be gained by asking why
and much to be gained by seeking God in one's pain.  As one Christian 
novelist said, <em>"The only thing more difficult than having a
relationship with an invisible God is having no such relationship"</em>.
</p>

<p>
For Christians, the invisible God is to be reached in the story of
Easter and this provides the answer to where God is to be found in our 
suffering.  We believe that Jesus is the Son of God, and when we say 
that he has died, we express the fact that all human suffering in time 
and space has been suffered by God himself.  There can be no human
beings who are left alone in their suffering because God, through
Jesus, has come to us.
</p>

<p>
Henri Nouwen says, <em>"Every time we hear more about the way human
beings are in pain, we come to know more about the immensity of God's
love, who did not want to exclude anything human from his experience
of being God"</em>.
</p>

<p>
We would like to invite you on Good Friday to attend some part of our
Easter meditation which begins at noon in St Mary's.  It will include
an interactive look at the whole area of human suffering and time for
reflection.  You can come and go just as you please throughout the
afternoon.
</p>

<p>
Have a good Easter.
