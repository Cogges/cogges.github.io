<h2>Bamboo - a parable from the East</h2>

<p>
There was in the East a garden. It was the most beautiful place in
creation, where each plant grew tall, strong and beautiful. The owner
of the garden tended it with the utmost care and devotion, loving
dearly everything that grew there. But of all the plants in his domain,
one was especially dear to him. In the centre of the garden grew a
handsome Bamboo tree, and when the Master walked among his shrubs and
flowers, it was in Bamboo that he took the greatest delight. Bamboo, in
his turn, flourished and grew strong under the loving gaze of his
Master.
</p>

<p>
One day, the Master came to Bamboo. "Bamboo," he said, "There is a task
which I must perform, and I would use you." "Master," replied Bamboo
with pleasure, "You know that I will do anything for you; use me as you
will."
</p>

<p>
The Master's voice grew grave. "Bamboo, I must first cut you down."
"Cut me down, Master?" Bamboo trembled at the thought. "I who am the
pride and joy of the whole garden, and more beloved of you than any
other plant? Would you cut me down?"
</p>

<p>
"Bamboo," replied the Master gently, "If I do not cut you down, I
cannot use you." Sadly, Bamboo bowed before the gardener. "Then,
Master, cut away; use me as you will."
</p>

<p>
The Master spoke again. "Bamboo, I must strip you of your leaves." The
words were like a chill blast of mountain air in Bamboo's heart.
"Master, cut me down if you must, but must you also strip me of my
leaves? They are my crowning glory!"
</p>

<p>
"Bamboo, if I do not strip you of your leaves, I cannot use you." With
mounting sorrow, Bamboo bowed again. "Then strip me of my leaves,
Master; use me as you will."
</p>

<p>
"Bamboo." The whole garden was hushed and trembling as the Master spoke
again.  "I must split open you trunk and hollow it out." Bamboo felt a
wave of inner anguish wash through him. Master," he said, You will cut
me down, you will strip me of my leaves; must you also split open my
trunk and hollow it out?" "Bamboo" - there were tears in the Master's
eyes - "If I do not do this, I cannot use you." In sorrowful
resignation, Bamboo bowed low before his Master for the last time.
"Then, Master, use me as you will."
</p>

<p>
So the gardener cut down Bamboo, and stripped him of his leaves, and
split open his trunk, and hollowed it out. And the channel of Bamboo's
broken body carried fresh, life-giving water from the well in the
garden out into the parched desert. There the soil became fertile, and
life sprang up where there had been only dust.
</p>

<p>
Join us this Holy Week and Easter as we worship the One whose body was
broken on the cross that we might have life, and who rose again in
victory.
