<h2> What is the hardest question you have ever been asked? </h2>

<p>
For me I stumbled across my hardest question half way through one of
those self answer quizzes found on training courses.
</p>
<p>
The instructions for the Myers-Briggs test were quite clear:  70 simple
questions demanding yes or no answers and they all have to be answered
in 15 minutes.
</p>
<p>
<em>Question 47: What is more important, mercy or justice?</em>
</p>
<p>
For a moment my hand froze over the tick box. Surely both are equally
important but so different.  How on earth can anyone say? Just a few
seconds left before I had to move onto the next question or risk
failing the test altogether.
</p>
<p>
Which box would you have ticked? I know that my wife ticked mercy and I
selected justice. And I came out with a personality profile shared with
Margaret Thatcher and my wife came out in the same grouping as Mother
Teresa!
</p>
<p>
How would God answer? You see if God is perfectly good how can He
accept any imperfection in his universe without compromising that
perfect goodness? We do not have to look very far to see how every day
we humans fall short of the glory of God. Just one unkind word to a
loved one compromises God's perfect goodness.
</p>
<p>
Yet God loves each and every one of us and desperately wants a deep and
personal relationship.  This in spite of all our shortcomings and
failings when measured against a standard of perfection.
</p>
<p>
You see justice and mercy are two sides of the same coin and essential
characteristics of God. They seem impossible to reconcile but in the
life, death and resurrection of Jesus that is exactly what has
happened. God so loved the world that he has sent his only Son to one
place, Israel, at one time, 2000 years ago, to reconcile mercy and
justice. Of his own free will Jesus lived a blameless life of service
and love but willingly took upon himself an agonizing death so that,
with the demands of justice met, all humanity can be freed to enjoy
God's love and mercy. Now and forever.
</p>
<p>
On second thoughts perhaps the hardest question we have to answer is
the one posed to us all by Jesus:
</p>
<p>
<strong>Who do you think I am?</strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>Now how would <strong>you</strong> answer that one?</em>
