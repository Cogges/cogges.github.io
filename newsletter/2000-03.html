<h1>Beyond our Ken</h1>

<p>
As I write this, the headline in my newspaper reads "Labour bid to
scupper Livingstone" and the news is dominated by the question that is
apparently on everyone's lips (although not on mine!) - "Will Ken
Livingstone run as an independent candidate for Mayor of London?"
</p>

<p>
Following as best as I can the twists and turns of the electoral
contest, what strikes me is the way in which the political debate is
contacted entirely in terms of personality. Ken is "a cheeky chappie"
while Frank is "Tony's crony".  What seems to miss most accounts is the
almost total agreement on policy between all the candidates. Apart from
a complex economic debate about how the London Underground should be
funded, all candidates agree on what the needs of Londoners are and are
keen to get on with the important issues of rubbishing each others
personality.
</p>

<p>
There are real dangers here for our political system. Democratic
politics thrives on debate, on the development of alternative
perspectives, and the challenging of ideas and policy. When we cease to
discuss or consider the underlying challenges, and focus instead on the
strengths and weaknesses of candidates' personalities, we run
substantial risks.
</p>

<p>
We can learn a great deal from the Old Testament psalmists and prophets
here.  They started from the assumption that power corrupts
personality. Therefore they were inherently suspicious of what their
leaders proposed. They were not afraid to challenge the assumptions and
policies of their leaders. They questioned the direction in which they
were being led; pointed out the logical conclusion of policy direction
and proposed radical alternatives.
</p>

<p>
It follows, then, that those who seek to be followers of Jesus of
Nazareth should refuse to be caught up in questions of political
personality, but keep a radical, questioning mind when it comes to
political propositions and be prepared to contribute that questioning
to the political debates of the day.
