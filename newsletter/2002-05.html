<h2>BRAVEHEART</h2>

<p>
I'm sure many of you have watched the film "Braveheart", the epic and
somewhat glamourised tale of the Scotsman, William Wallace, who
attempted to banish the English from his land.  It all ends in tears
when, for a full ten minutes of screen time, we watch the hero tortured
and eventually executed.
</p>

<p>
It moved me to tears.  I watched the film on Easter Saturday and
couldn't help feeling guilty over tears shed for this screen hero when,
so often, around Easter, I remain dry-eyed for what they did to Jesus.
I wanted to feel the same emotions for his suffering as I did for
William Wallace.
</p>

<p>
Why William Wallace?  Why not Jesus?  Maybe it has something to do with
the  immediacy of the big screen.  Maybe, because it's hard to see the
relevance of an event that took place two thousand years ago.  Let me
explain, then, how Jesus would have suffered.
</p>

<p>
He was stripped and tied to a whipping post where he was flogged with
four or five thongs of leather interwoven with sharp jagged bone and
lead.  Eusebius, the third century historian, described Roman flogging
like this: "the sufferers veins were laid bare, and the very muscles,
sinews and bowels of the victim were open to exposure".  Jesus was
mocked by a battalion of six hundred men, beaten by them around the
face and had a crown of thorns thrust into his head.
</p>

<p>
"He was forced to carry a heavy cross bar on his bleeding shoulders
until he collapsed.  When they reached the site of crucifixion, he was
again stripped naked and laid bare on the cross, six inch nails were
twisted side-ways so that the ankles could be nailed between the tibia
and the Achilles' tendon.  He was lifted up on the cross which was
dropped, with a shudder, into the ground.  There he was left to hang in
the intense heat and unbearable thirst for six hours whilst his life
drained away." [Excerpt from Nicky Gumble's book - "Questions of Life"]
</p>

<p>
William Wallace was a hero - Jesus was a King.  "Braveheart" ended with
the death of Wallace.  Life begins with the death of Jesus!
</p>

<p>
The Anglican Historian, Neville Figgis, says "that the criterion of any
religion lies in what it has to tell us about death".  The two words
that confirm Christianity has much to say about death are spoken in the
middle of Jesus' hell from the cross - "with me".  Spoken to the common
criminal who threw himself on the mercy of God.  "I tell you the truth,
today you will be with me in Paradise".
</p>

<p>
These are the words that secure a life beyond the grave - even for a
common piece of low-life.  What did he have to offer?  Certainly
nothing in the way of human virtue other than his sinfulness.  What did
he understand about Jesus?  Well, very little - certainly no broad
doctrine of belief or deep scriptural insight into Christ's identity.
But enough to cast his hopes on Jesus and not be disappointed.
</p>

<p>
What Jesus recognised in his face was genuine commitment.  It's what he
seeks from us today.  Not just at Easter, or Christmas or even each
Sunday.  But every day of our lives.  Like the criminal, all we can
offer Jesus is our sinfulness and a genuine commitment to follow him.
Michael Green, an Anglican Evangelist suggests that, "a finger-hold on
Jesus is enough to bring me into an initial relationship with him..."
</p>

<p>
I pray that in this Easter season you will take hold of the words of
Jesus, reported in John's Gospel, when he says, "Anyone who comes to me
I will never turn away".
