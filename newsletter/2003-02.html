<h2>Parenthood</h2>

<p>
What a year of change it has been -- not only in the world at large, but
in my own situation.  Almost a year ago my mother died, the last of the
older generation, and on the day of her funeral my first grandchild was
born (my son's), to be followed only four weeks later by the second (my
daughter's).
</p><p>
One of the delights of this year of change has been to see both babies
growing from their initial helplessness and total dependence, and
beginning to develop quite distinctive personalities and a growing range
of skills.  Another delight has been to see how both couples have risen
to the challenge of parenthood.  I doubt whether they'd ever fully
reckoned on the upheaval a child would cause them -- not just the
sleepless nights, but the re-ordered priorities, the constant
attention.  But they have committed themselves to making it work, and it
shows -- the love and care, the patience and gentleness, the concern when
things go wrong, the desire to give the best, the constant support, the
encouraging of new skills, the bond of understanding that doesn't need
words.
</p><p>
Yet what I see in these new parents is only a shadow of the love of
God.  For Jesus described becoming a Christian as a new birth -- becoming
a child of the heavenly Father.  There is no match for his love, his
patience is inexhaustible, he is always ready to pick us up and dust us
down when we fall, he longs to see us develop and thrive and enjoy life
to the full, and we can always count on him to guide us when the way is
dark and encourage us when it's tough.
He just wants us to ask, and to trust him.  As Jesus put it: "If you,
though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how
much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask
him!"
</p><p>
In a year of change like this I've been very glad of the security and
confidence that a relationship with the heavenly Father can bring.
