<h2>Overcome Evil with Good</h2>

<p>
As I write this, news is coming through the BBC News website of the
forceful ending of the Moscow Theatre siege
</p><p>
This action is but the latest event in which people who proclaim the
highest religious motivation are prepared to kill and be killed for what
they claim are sincere religious goals: 9/11 in New York; the
Israel/Palestine armed conflict; the war against the Taliban in
Afghanistan; Muslim/Hindu riots in Gujarat; the Bali bomb.
</p><p>
In a hard-hitting article in the Guardian in September, Polly Toynbee
argued that lethal violence was a necessary part of religious belief. To
reduce the threat of violence, we must remove religious beliefs of all
types. Of course, she is disingenuous. The greatest mass slaughters this
century (the Great Leap Forward in China in 1959-61 and the forced
collectivisation in Stalin's Russia in the 1930's) were associated with
strong anti-religious campaigns. And it would be hard to claim Hitler as
an orthodox believer of any type!
</p><p>
But Christians need to be aware that there is a long history in the
Church of seeking to impose our views on others, by force if necessary.
There are too many examples to list here. When we seek to do so, we fly
in the face of both Jesus' teaching, and his example.  Jesus, in
first-century occupied Palestine, was surrounded by groups advocating
the creation of the Kingdom of God by violent means. He not only
rejected such approaches but predicted the outcome. He was right. When
Jewish radicals rose in revolt against Rome in 66AD, they brought the
might of the Roman army down on them, resulting in their own slaughter
and the destruction of Jerusalem.
</p><p>
Jesus' way is a different way. It is a way that renounces power and
violence. It is a way that embraces suffering and sacrifice. It is a way
that leads to, and through the Cross.
</p><p>
Jesus' disciple Paul, wrestling with a debilitating illness as he sought
to bring the good news of Jesus to the Roman world, heard God say to him
"power is made perfect in weakness". In a world addicted to power and
violence, as Christians do we not have something different to say?

"Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good" (Romans 12:21)
