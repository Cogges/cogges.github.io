<h2>Life is precious...</h2>

<p><strong>
By the time the Sweeneys have finished watching 'Strictly Come
Dancing' on a Sunday evening I know the weekend is almost over and I'm
left thinking, where on earth did the time go?
</strong></p>
<p>
I wonder how quickly the weekend passes for you? For that matter, I
wonder how quickly life passes for you?  The trouble with life is that
it simply doesn't have a rewind button -- every day, every second,
carries with it its own finality. Time is our one indisputable
non-renewable resource. My mother, who is seventy nine, commented the
other week how she still feels fifty inside, that is until she catches
a glimpse of herself in a shop window!
</p>
<p>
At the end of every day, one more box on the calendar has been shifted
from the future column to the past column, from possibility to
history, and all of its moments can be celebrated or regretted, but
can never be retrieved.
</p>
<p>
Medical journalist Dr Timothy Johnson writes:
</p>
<blockquote><p><em>
"...life has an urgency so different to fiction; at the end, it cannot
be changed!  The meaning of life is that it stops.  We will never
figure out how we should live our lives unless we fully understand the
significance of the fact that it will end. And then what?"
</em></p></blockquote>
<p>
Of course our lives are full of commitments but, as so often happens,
it is the unspoken commitments that rob us of our lives. What do you
think they might be? In the UK, children between the ages of five and
eleven watch on average forty hours of television each week; husbands
and wives spend three to four times as much time watching television
as they do talking to one another. You see, it is the unspoken
commitments that drive our lives and rob us of the possibility of
precious moments.
</p>
<p>
A young businessman always made it his business to ask older men their
regrets. At the top of their list was "I was so busy trying to improve
my family's standard of living that, before I knew it, my children
were grown and gone, and I never got to know them.  Now they are too
busy for me".
</p>
<p>
Life is too short and too precious to leave it full of regrets.
</p>
<p>
John Ortberg, in another one of his challenging and immensely readable
books, suggests four regrets that people often mention when they get
to the end of their lives:
</p>
<ul>
<li>I would have loved more deeply.
<li>I would have laughed more often.
<li>I would have given more generously.
<li>I would have lived more boldly.
</ul>
<p>
We always think that there will eventually be time to do all these
things that we never have the time to do. My father looked forward to
retirement to spend more time with my mum -- he died at the age of
fifty three!
</p>
<p>
Leo Tolstoy commented, <em>"What if my life, my conscious life, has
not been the right thing?"</em>
</p>
<p>
It seems a real shame, to me, if we wait for a crisis before we
consider what really is essential about life -- I see it often.
Wouldn't it be better to re-order our way of thinking and our way of
operating to consider what it might be like to live life without
regret?
</p>
<p>
This Christmas we consider, once more, the reasons why the birth of
Jesus has significance for a world that so often believes it has the
solutions to its own problems. There is one problem that we cannot
fathom, though -- it is a crisis that always comes.  But surely it is
better not to wait!
</p>
<p>
Let me finish with these wonderful words from the Gospel of John,
</p>
<blockquote><p><em> 
"The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood
it....  yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his
name, he gave the right to become children of God."
</em></p></blockquote>
<p>
May I wish you a joyful Christmas from all at St Marys, Cogges and
St James the Great, South Leigh.
