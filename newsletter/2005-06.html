<h2>What is your passion?</h2>

<p><strong>
For many British it has got to be football....the enthusiasm and the
excitement it evokes, every household stops when it's the `big match',
out with the beers and away with the children or any other such
interruption!    For others those little white golf balls have a certain
charm, it draws people to local golf clubs to wile away the hours
hooking one out of the rough or the sand!.  Then there's retail
therapy.....now that's a passion for many.....especially if there is the
chance of a bargain!.
</strong></p>

<p><strong>
It is interesting to note that most national charities are run by
passionate people  who have personal experience of cancer, blindness or
other such illnesses. Out of an  experience which was usually a negative
one, comes a passion to help those who are suffering in the same way.
Yet we are told that society today has never been as anti organisations
and person centred.  Is that really true?
</strong></p>

<p>
I  live on Madley Park a new estate in Witney. I find that here I
exercise my own personal passion which is `building community'. When I
first moved onto the estate 18 months ago it was not uncommon to hear
mums say that they would walk the estate during the day just trying to
find someone to talk to.  The houses on Madley Park have high walls for
protection and security both very valuable but not great for chatting to
ones neighbour, pretty well impossible actually!!
</p>

<p>
There are now 600 occupied houses with another 500+ in the process
of being built. Has anything changed?  Well the young mums say that the
Toddlers@ 10 group has been a great place of meeting, as has the new
playground. Other events such as the Business Network lunches and the
forthcoming School Ball all help to build community.   But what about
those who work away from home.......the 7 am -7 pm brigade....how do
they meet each other?  Well a Jazz evening was well received and summer
barbeques are on the cards....... all it takes people to come along to
make them `community building' events.
</p>

<p>
So how can we create a community? Well at Cogges they run
Seniors gatherings every second Friday afternoon in the month, there are
care groups to help those in need, a Toddler group, a ladies group, a
Marriage Enrichment Course, a new place for 13+ aged youngsters to meet.
 Great community initiatives and all run by.......the church.  The
church is at the centre of local `community building'. So the next time
you say `phah' when you hear the church being mentioned, and you are
tempted to talk about its irrelevance, just reflect on how many
community activities are initiated by the local churches in Witney. They
are just following the model of a  passionate man called Jesus whose
love for everyone regardless of race, colour, or creed..... was life
changing.  A person worth getting to know!!!
