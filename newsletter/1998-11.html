<H1>Whose Millennium is it anyway?</H1>
</CENTER>

Are you ready to cope with the Millennium Bug?  It sounds like
something out of a sixties sci-fi horror film doesn't it?  It might
conjure up visions of some dreadful contamination from outer space
that's poised to strike at civilisation at the stroke of midnight on
December 31st 1999.  But don't panic -- it's not a bug at all.  All it
means is that some computer systems won't be able to recognise the date
2000 because they've been programmed to think that every year must
begin with the number 19.  That's not to say it isn't serious.  A lot
of things that we take for granted could cease to work unless something
is done to correct all those computers.<P>

One way or another, this Millennium business is attracting a lot of
attention.  There's the famous (or infamous) Millennium Dome. For some,
it's a great idea for a national celebration.  For others, it's a
colossal waste of taxpayers' money.  Already, many communities are
planning how they will mark the Millennium, with special events and
projects.<P>

But have you stopped to ask why there is this focus on the Millennium
in the first place?  What's the significance of the number 2000?  Why
is that year any different from any other?  In one sense, it's hard to
see what all the fuss is about.  It's just another number, just another
year.<P>

But in another sense, it's quite thrilling to think that so many people
will be going out of their way to mark the occasion.  They will be
celebrating the anniversary of the arrival on earth as a human being of
Jesus Christ, the Son of God.  He is the reason for the whole thing,
because that new year will be 2000 Anno Domini -- the two thousandth
year of the Lord.<P>

Now I'm not sure that everybody who is preparing for it realises that.
Imagine it's your birthday, and you hold a party, and invite all your
friends and relatives.  How would you feel if they arrived at your home
one by one, greeted one another, drank toasts to one another and gave
each other presents, all the while completely ignoring you?  It would
be a very strange birthday!  Celebrating the two thousandth anniversary
of Jesus' arrival without considering him could be equally strange.<P>

Churches Together in Witney are planning a
series of special events beginning next year to mark the
Millennium, and focus attention on Jesus, whose anniversary it is, and
who is still the greatest need of this world.  Watch out for
details!<P>
