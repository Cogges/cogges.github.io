<h2>Read the Instructions!</h2>

<p><strong>
I was trying to understand the tiny buttons on the new personal CD
player.  "I can't make it out", I thought, "it won't work".    I got a
brisk thought in reply: "If all else fails, get the manual...!"  I
quickly picked up a booklet but even that did not seem to help, and I
got another brisk thought: "Are you sure you've got the right manual?"
I hadn't, but a steady read of the right one solved the difficulties.
I had been guilty of thinking I could solve all the problems on my own, 
and had only managed to waste time.  Rather like driving along a 
strange route, not quite knowing where you are, when you
really ought to have stopped and been humble enough to ask the way.
</strong></p><p><strong>
These days this sort of thing seems to crop up in other circumstances
too.   Talk to people and they will have a lot to say about things that
have gone wrong when they should have gone right, and nobody seems to
know how to fix them.</strong>   All sorts of unhappy things like violence, bad
sex, failing marriages, drug dependency, crime rates, hooliganism and so
on.    Could it be that these days there is a general tendency to ignore
our Maker's Instructions and think we can fix things ourselves with
ideas that might seem more up to date and less restrictive?
</p><p>
About this time of year in church we have "Bible Sunday" because of the
fine old set prayer which starts "Blessed Lord, who has caused all holy
Scripture to be written for our learning."    A statement that does not
go down too well in these PC days of looking askance at any concept that
says there is an ultimate source of truth.   True, the Bible is a very
complex set of books.    Some terribly difficult to make head or tale
of, some with statements as neat and plain as you could wish for even if
they are tough.  "If all else fails, read the Instructions" and in this
Maker's Manual you can find a lot of answers.    Guidelines for bringing
up children, running a good business, making a stable marriage, seeking
healing, looking after one another, and so on.
</p><p>
Even so, although you may have the right manual in your hand, it is
often very helpful to be able to talk to someone who knows more about
the matter than you do.   Any computer user will tell you this.    It is
the same with God's instructions on life, and should you be badly stuck
about the way forward in some problem or other, it might be worth coming
to one or other of us at Cogges.   There is a good chance we could say,
"I see what you mean.   I think it might be helpful to do this..."
