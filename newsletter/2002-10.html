Have you ever heard someone say "These things are sent to try us" or
perhaps you say it yourself.  When we do say it I don't think we
literally mean that God is deliberately making our lives more difficult,
rather we mean "what will be will be".
</p><p>
Nevertheless many people are fatalistic in their approach to life,
believing that many aspects of their lives are fixed and that they can
do nothing to change them.  Some people believe that the movement of the
planets and stars set the patterns for our lives.  
</p><p>
Do we really believe that we have no control over our lives, as if we
are puppets with some impersonal force pulling the strings?  I must say
I find this view of the world very difficult to live with.  As a
Christian I believe in a God who is behind the creation of the universe
certainly, but also a tender loving God who loves and cares for us
personally.  The idea that he would deliberately makes our lives   
difficult or create stars and planets to control our lives is not one
that I can identify with.
</p><p>
Also I believe that as human beings we are responsible for our own
actions and that the decisions we make will affect our future.  If I
lash out unfairly at someone, it will affect our relationship.  If I
choose to smoke it may affect my health.  If I am generous to others,
they are more likely to be generous to me.
</p><p>
So do you believe in fate, "whatever will be will be" or in a loving
compassionate God who reaches out to us all in love?  The choice is
yours.
