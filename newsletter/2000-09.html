 <h3>What they're saying about Alpha</h3>

 <p>
 <strong>Syd Little</strong> (of "Little and Large"):<br>
 <em>I think Alpha is an excellent idea.  I've listened to it myself,
 and found it explains things in a way that I would probably otherwise
 not have understood.</em><br clear="all">
 </p>

</div>

<h2> What happens at Alpha? </h2>

<p>
Each week, we share a meal together in the home of local Christians,
then hear a talk on an aspect of the Christian faith - such as
</p>
<ul>
<li>Who is Jesus?</li>
<li>Why did Jesus die?</li>
<li>How can I be sure of my faith?</li>
<li>Why and how should I read the Bible?</li>
<li>Why and how do I pray?</li>
<li>What about the Holy Spirit?</li>
<li>How can I resist evil?</li>
<li>How does God guide us?</li>
<li>Why and how should we tell others?</li>
<li>Does God heal today?</li>
<li>What about the church?</li>
</ul>
<p>
After each talk there is time in a small group for everyone to
discuss any issues or questions they have, giving them the opportunity 
to get to know each other and learn together.
</p>

 <strong>Sir David Frost</strong> (who will present an ITV series on
 Alpha next year):<br>
 <em>I think it is terrific that ITV is prepared to do something like
 this, and I think that viewers who are interested will really be able
 to gain something from the series.</em><br clear="all">
 </p>

 <p>
 <strong>Time Magazine</strong>:<br>
 <em>Alpha to the rescue...  The biggest selling point is that many
 claim Alpha has changed their lives, and appear genuinely happier
 for the experience.  And they are going to church...</em>
 </p>

 <p>
 <strong>Newsweek</strong> (describing Nicky Gumbel, Alpha's main
 speaker):<br>
 <em>"God's own Adman."</em>

<h2>Blue Peter presenter: "This is the best thing
    that has ever happened to me"</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://www.alpha.org.uk/news/00-02/page2.htm">
<img border="2" src="http://www.alphacourse.org.uk/images/diane_square.jpg" 
     width="60" height="60" alt="" align="left"></a>
Former Blue Peter personality Diane Louise Jordan says "I used to think
that if you were a Christian you couldn't have a brain, because there
was no way an intelligent person could believe in something they
couldn't see." So she was amazed when BBC's <em>Songs of Praise</em>
asked her to present one of their programmes.  "I thought, 'Why have
they chosen me? This is just bizarre....'" The programme came from
Lourdes, and against all her expectations, she found it a strangely
moving experience.  As a direct result she tried the Alpha Course held
at Holy Trinity, Brompton.  Work commitments prevented her from
attending all the sessions, but when <em>Songs of Praise</em> asked her
to do a programme about Alpha, she knew she had to have another go.
"During that time," she says, "God sort of crept up on me really
gently, and he has been creeping up ever since.  I have to say that
this is the best thing that has ever happened to me.  It has completely
transformed my life for the better.  There is just no comparison
between the old me and the new me, really.  Even my friends are saying
'You are much nicer now!' "
