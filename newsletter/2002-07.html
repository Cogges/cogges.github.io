<h2>The Journey of Life</h2>

<p>
"The Journey of Life may be easy, may be hard" is a song that you may
remember from your school days.  It is certainly a general observation
that many recognise to be true.  At a time when many teenagers are
sitting exams or have just completed them and wait anxiously for
results, there is time to reflect on how hard some have worked and how
much easier study comes to some than others.  How frustrating it is
when your peers gain good grades seemingly effortlessly, while others
study hard and achieve less.
</p> <p>
In adulthood too there are those who seem very capable in their work,
have stable relationships and everything appears to go swimmingly.
Others, often through no fault of their own, have a much more bumpy
ride.  Whether or not we find life difficult, the pressure of life and
work seem to be ever increasing.  Never before has there been so much
opportunity for hobbies, leisure and travel and yet the daily grind of
life for many is a wearisome burden.
</p> <p>
Jesus invited us "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and
I will give you rest".  However easy or hard we find the journey of
life, we all need rest.  Over this summer, may I suggest you find some
time for rest and contemplation.  The rest that Jesus offers has a
quality to it; Rest for us today in this world and in the next.
</p> <p>
Perhaps surprisingly this rest is not only for the high achievers and
the most intelligent.  For Jesus goes on to say "I praise you Father,
Lord of Heaven and Earth, because you have hidden these things from
the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children".  The
contrast implied here by Jesus is not one of intellect or status but
rather between the self-sufficient who deem themselves wise and those,
like little children, who are dependent and eager to learn.
</p> <p>
"The Journey of Life may be easy, may be hard" but we all need our
point of rest.  Perhaps this summer offers you an opportunity for some
solitude.  May I encourage you to take up Jesus' offer.  "Come to me,
all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest".
