<p><strong>
Welcome to the new Crosstalk newsletter.  Much of our attention here
in St Mary's over the past year has focussed on developing links 
into the Parish of Cogges.
</strong></p><p>
The new Crosstalk magazine is one small further attempt at connecting 
with  our community. We aim to review all the positive activities of 
the previous  months in the Parish and look forward to the many events 
that we hope will  interest you. 
</p><p>
Our aim is to produce the magazine 
three times a year, before Christmas, at  Easter and at the beginning 
of the Autumn term.  I hope you like the  picture gallery in this 
edition capturing such events as the retirement of Blake  School' s 
head teacher, Tim Massey;  Infant Sports Day at Blake School and  the 
Scouts first meeting in the Church Centre.   
</p><p><strong>
This year we really want to be part of  your Christmas celebrations and 
have geared many of our church activities  around what we hope will help 
you have the most meaningful and complete  Christmas yet.
</strong></p><p>
Let me leave you with a few words for reflection as we come close to the  
Christmas season.    
</p><p><strong>
I believe God comes as a companion this Christmas 
to join us on the road, to  listen to our story and to help us realize 
that life can be more than walking in  circles but moving towards the 
house of peace and love. In the great mystery of Christmas, the one thing
that God wants us to know is that in the birth of  his son, Jesus Christ,
there is no need to walk alone through life.</strong>
The God of  love who gave us 
life, sent his Son to be with us in all our struggles - in all  the good 
things that life brings. Here is another Christmas that brings joyful 
stress or maybe just stress often accompanied by anxiety. Christmas is  
another opportunity to accept the renewed invitation not to be afraid, 
not to be anxious and to let Him - whose love is greater than our hearts 
and minds can comprehend - be our companion.  
</p><p>
I want to invite you personally to come  and celebrate the full meaning 
of <a href="../xtmas.html">Christmas</a> with us in St Mary's.
