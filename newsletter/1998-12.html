<H1>BC - AD:  The Turning Point</H1>
</CENTER>

What was it?<P>

What made the birth of one baby boy the turning point, the start of a
new era, the pivot of human history?<P>

<DL>

<DT><EM>Not the place:</EM>
<DD>His birth happened in a small provincial town a thousand miles from
    Rome, the seat of power.<P>

<DT><EM>Not the people:</EM>
<DD>His parents were an ordinary country couple who couldn't even get a
    decent roof over their heads, and within months they were political
    refugees.<P>

<DT><EM>Not the time:</EM>
<DD>There were no great, decisive events on the world scene - it was a
    time of relative stability and peace.<P>

</DL>

So what was it?<P>

It was the boy himself - Jesus - God become man.  He is the turning
point of human history - and much more - since he was born, countless
millions have found him the turning point of their lives.<P>

Are you one of them?<P>
