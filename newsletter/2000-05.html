  <h1>God's Acre - The churchyard at St Mary's</h1>
</center>

<p>
Over the past few years you may have noticed some small areas of the
churchyard have been left unmown during the spring and summer.  This
has been a positive attempt to promote the growth of wild flowers and
encourage a greater variety of wildlife within the churchyard area.
The existing variety of habitat is very good.  Holly trees and Ivy
covered tree stumps offer ideal conditions for a range of
invertebrates.
</p>

<p>
For example, caterpillars of the Holly Blue butterfly feed on Holly
flowers in their spring generation and on the flowers of Ivy during the
autumn generation - the only British butterfly whose main foodplant
changes through the seasons.  Grass areas left uncut have produced a
good number of Primroses this year, and we hope that the striking
Orange Hawkweed flowers will appear again later in the season in the
area under the wall of the old School (now the Cogges Church Centre).
Perhaps with continued care and management other wild flowers will
appear!
</p>

<p>
So that we continue to enhance this natural beauty of the churchyard
and to comply with our 
<a href="../stmarys/chydregs.html">Churchyard Regulations</a>
(posted in the Church porch) please remove all artificial flowers from
the churchyard.  Thank you for your assistance in this
matter.
