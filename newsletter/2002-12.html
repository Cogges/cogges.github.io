<h2>Christmas</h2>

<p>
As your Vicar in this Parish, concerned about your welfare, I thought you
might like some advice on Christmas eating:
</p>
<ol>
<li>If you eat something and no one sees you eat it, it has no calories.
<li>When you eat with someone else calories don't count if you don't eat
    more than they do.
<li>If you fatten everyone else around you, you'll look thinner.
<li>Things licked off spoons have no calories, especially home-made brandy
    butter.
<li>Foods with similar colouring have the same calories, ie turkey and
    white chocolate
</ol>
<p>
I suspect you would be wise not to follow my advice about Christmas eating!
But if I had a moment of your time what would it be essential for me to say 
to you about Christmas?
</p><p>
Well, Christians believe that Christmas was God's first great act of love -
coming to earth as a human, a human called Jesus.  It was to show that God 
loves us not because of anything we've done but because of who He is.  I 
know that many believe secretly that God will only love them when they do 
well - after all that's the world's expectation of us, isn't it? Let me
tell you now - no, this is not God's way at all. We can do nothing to earn
His love, it is His free gift to us. The truth is that the message that
Christianity offers is a surprise - above all, because unlike other 
religions and the way of the world, it dares to make God's love
unconditional.
</p><p>
So stop, just for a moment, and ponder that God came to earth in human form
because He loves you and cares for you. He loves you even if you don't know
him and He loves you when you call him Father.
</p><p>
Can I wish you and your families a really peaceful Christmas from all of us
here at St.Mary's.
