<h2>Christmas Presence</h2>

<p>
In the hustle and bustle of preparing for Christmas, it is easy to
forget what we are preparing for and why we all doing it.  It is not
difficult to get carried away with all that has to be done.  May I
encourage you to take time to reflect.  Maybe, in your heart of hearts,
you are looking for a sign or some event that will reveal to you the
glory of God.  I don't know whether the farmers in Bethlehem were
looking for a sign but they certainly received one.  Nothing less than
an angel appeared to them while they were tending their sheep.  The
angel said to them:
</p>

<blockquote>
<img src="../img/angel.gif" width="86" height="86" border="0" align="left" alt="">
<em>"Do not be afraid.  I bring you good news of  great joy that will be
for all the people.  Today in the town of David a Saviour has been born
to you; he is Christ the Lord.  This will be a sign to you:  You will
find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger."</em>
<br clear="all">
</blockquote>

<p>
Few of us will have had an encounter like this, though I am sure that
some people today have been visited by an angel.  Never the less many
of us do have an encounter with God at a most unexpected time.  Perhaps
you have experienced the presence of God with you and have been taken
by surprise.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the search for meaning is something that has passed you by or
you are too afraid to even think about God.  Just listen to the angel
once again,  "Do not be afraid.  I bring you good news of great joy ....."
On Christmas day God sent his only Son into the world to be
the saviour of the world.  Maybe he is not so remote after all.
</p>

<p>
<em><strong>Wishing you Joy and Peace this Christmas</strong></em>
