<h2>Don't let it pass you by</h2>

<p><strong>
There is a modern disease that has, as yet, no known cure.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>
Many clever people have worked tirelessly to find a remedy, but none
have proved effective.
</strong></p>


<p><strong>
This disease is particularly prevalent around Christmas when it seems
to afflict mothers and grand mothers more than most. The disease --
'hurry sickness'.

One would think that at least all the amazing
technological and scientific advances would have bought us a little
more time and space for re-creation and restoration. Just think of all
the amazing time saving advances that ought to have enhanced our
personal time: two in one shampoos (no need to rinse our hair twice),
drive through takeaway food (allowing us to eat in cars as nature
intended), food scanners in supermarkets, 5 items or less check-outs
(why do they always have the longest queue?), broad-band internet
access (now we can go 'online' in five seconds instead of twenty --
trouble is, we stay online twenty times longer!)
</strong></p>
<p>
Our world has become the world of the Red Queen in 'Alice and
Wonderland: "Now here, you see, it takes all the running you can do,
to keep in the same place.  If you want to get somewhere else, you
must run at least twice as fast as that!"
</p><p>
So here is the question for you, "Have all the amazing time saving
ideas increased your own personal time? Have they enabled you to find
another day on the golf course or a fourth session at the gym or an
extra night at home with your family?" Can you at least say honestly
that you have a general sense of more time and increased well-being?
</p><p>
The American sociologist, Robert Banks notes that while western
society is rich in goods, it is extremely 'time poor'. He says that,
in contrast many societies in the two thirds world are poor material
possessions by our standards, but they are rich in time.
</p><p>
And from about now I would say you are accelerating towards Christmas
as the hype encourages you to do, and the pressure to feed the
materialistic appetites of your youngest increases. To live this way,
waiting for Christmas, means we will miss much along the way and feel
let down if 'the day' doesn't live up to its promise.
</p><p>
In the middle of all the hurry and the preparations and the dead-lines
we can choose a different way -a way of proper preparation. As we
eagerly pull another fifty pounds from the 'hole-in-the-wall', we
could choose to meditate for a moment on the words of a carol churned
out from the high street speaker, 'Hark the herald Angels sing,
"Glory!" to the new born King' or 'Hail the heaven-born Prince of
Peace! Hail the Son of righteousness! Light and life to all he brings,
risen with healing in his wings' or 'Peace on earth and mercy mild, God
and sinners reconciled'.
</p><p>
Your preparations could begin with the lighting of the first candle at
the start of Advent or while you watch your five-year-old grandchild
perform in the school nativity or as you listen to carol concerts and
'scratch' performances of Handel's Messiah.
</p><p>
The wonder of Christmas is found in the meaning that God attaches to
it and not the slant fed to us by the slickest of advertising
campaigns. In the birth of Jesus, God has come near to bring light
into our darkness and hope into our emptiness.
</p><p>
We would love you to begin your preparations for Christmas with us
this year -- we've tried to gear our celebrations in the benefice
towards the whole community -- with something for everyone. You'll
find a programme of events in this issue and posters on the Priory
gate, Church Office and in our local schools.
</p><p><strong>
Wishing you a meaningful Christmas and much peace from all of us at
St Mary's.
