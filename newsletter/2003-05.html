<h2>The toppling of an evil regime</h2>

<p><strong>
These were the headlines following the events in Iraq on April 9, when 
American troops were welcomed into Baghdad and helped the Iraqis pull 
down a statue of Saddam Hussein.  But as we have seen, the removal of the 
evil regime is only the beginning of the story.  In a country that has suffered 
under an evil dictator for so many years creating a new way of life is going to 
be a difficult process.  Once the source of the Iraqi people's fear and 
repression was removed, their freedom led to anarchy.
</strong></p>
<p>
Having prayed for Iraq before the war, that the evil regime might be broken 
without the suffering that war inevitably brings, we must go on praying for a 
new stability in the country, with freedom not fear, justice not abuse, love not 
hate, at the heart of its new government.
</p><p>
Ten days later, on Easter Sunday, we celebrated the toppling of another evil 
regime.  Nearly 2000 years ago Jesus Christ, by his death and resurrection, 
overcame the evil caused by our determination to live our lives independent of 
God.
</p><p>
Our selfish living, our sin, has separated us from God as well as harmed our 
relationships with one another.  Jesus, the only person who ever lived a 
perfect life, offered his life for us when he died on the cross.  In the Bible we 
read "God made him who had no sin to be sin for us".  When Jesus died 
on the cross, his greatest agony was not the torture of the nail pierced hands 
and feet, the crown of thorns, the taunts of the crowds or even the slow brutal 
death, but the fact that for the first time his relationship with his Father was 
broken as he took the punishment for sin in our place.
</p><p>
God, our Father, accepted Jesus' death in the place of the punishment of 
death that we deserve.  All we need to do, is accept Jesus' gift of forgiveness 
and a new start to life, which we have just celebrated this Easter, and live our 
lives for him, rather than for ourselves.
</p><p>
As I am praying for Iraq, I am also praying for this community that freedom not 
fear, justice not abuse, love not hate, will be at its heart.  Only when Jesus 
Christ is at the heart of all we do will this be possible.
