<br>
<strong>I will praise you O Lord with all my heart.</strong> <br>
I will worship you and continually thank you <br>
for your love and faithfulness. <br>
I am exceedingly grateful that you <br>
always hear my cries for help; <br>
you answer me with mercy, <br>
you give me strength to be bold. <br>
<br>
If only the leaders of world governments <br>
would listen to your words <br>
and order their people according to your will. <br>
Then they would know the true meaning of peace, <br>
and they would rejoice together for the Lord is great. <br>
And why should they listen:  God is high above but <br>
sees far below;  he knows everything about us. <br>
<br>
You do not shield me from trouble and conflict; <br>
you keep me safe in your arms. <br>
You are with me even in sorrow and suffering. <br>
You protect me from those who attempt to harm me; <br>
you will not allow them to destroy me. <br>
<br>
Lord fulfil your purpose for my life. <br>
Your love is for ever and ever. <br>  
Do not abandon the works of your hands. <br>
