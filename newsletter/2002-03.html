<h2> Righteous Anger - me or thee? </h2>

<p>
Some of us have a bit of a temper. As my family and friends will
testify, over the years I have mellowed and learned to count to 10.
Though I must admit there are still the very rare occasions when I
cannot get beyond two before exploding.
<br clear="all">
</p>

<p>
Christians recognise that being angry is part of being human. Even Jesus
was prone to indignation:  In the temple courts he found men selling
cattle, sheep and doves, and others sitting at tables exchanging money.
So he made a whip out of cords, and drove all from the temple area, both
sheep and cattle; he scattered the coins of the moneychangers and
overturned their tables.
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+2:13-17&amp;language=english&amp;version=NIV">
John 2:14-15</a>
</p>

<p>
Now before you put this newsletter down in the belief that it is your
Christian duty to get physical when exercised by others, please note the
motivation of Jesus. What was it that drove the meek and mild Son of God
to such apoplexy?  We read in v 16: To those who sold doves he said,
"Get these out of here!  How dare you turn my Father's house into a
market!"
</p>

<p>
You see Jesus was not incensed by some affront to his own dignity eg how
dare you treat ME like that. No, what really upset him was: how dare you
treat MY FATHER like that.
</p>

<p>
There are some very bad reasons to get annoyed usually associated with
pride and a jealous defence of self against others who do not have the
vision or insight to recognise you for the wonderful genius you are.
Why don't friends and loved ones appreciate how lucky they are to have
you around!  It makes us so angry.
A word of caution, getting angry about perceived slights to self is
almost always wrong.
</p>

<p>
But there is a very good reason why anger is a God given part of human
nature. There are times when we are supposed to get really worked up and
exercised. It is about slights to others.  No let me put it stronger
than that. Anger is a natural response to injustice.
</p>

<p>
What is your response to wrong: indifference or indignation? A specific
example will do.  As I write our Prime Minister is just back from a trip
to Africa.  That continent creates 1% of the world's wealth but hosts
10% of the globe's population. Living standards are falling year-by-year
and hundreds of millions of our fellow human beings are living on less
than $1 a day - the price of a can of coca cola. Tony Blair has
described the current state of poverty in Africa as 
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/africa/newsid_1575000/1575428.stm">
"a scar on our consciences"</a>.
</p>

<p>
The reasons for this deepening poverty are complex - as are the reasons
to explain why obesity is now a major problem facing the developed
world. We in the West live in a world where 1 in 4 are clinically
overweight while 1,000,000,000 people in the developing world live on
less than 65p a day.
</p>

<p>
So what gets you angry: slights against self or the plight of the
world's poor? Interesting question. I once asked a student if they were
concerned about inequality and so many living in absolute poverty. Their
response: no, I am not one of them. And they were not joking.
</p>

<p>
This is the season of Lent.  What have you and I given up - some
non-essential like chocolate?  Instead why not give up something trivial
and take up something righteous. I suggest we all abandon temper at
pricked pride and take up righteous anger on behalf of others.  Rather
than how dare you treat ME like that, let's substitute how dare you
treat God the fathers' children like that.  And do not count much beyond
2 before acting.
