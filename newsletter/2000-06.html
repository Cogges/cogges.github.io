<h2>Plain Speaking</h2>

<p>
One of my favourite "Newspeak" phrases is the one that occurred during
an American space launch: "The Spacecraft" intoned the commentator "has
presently entered a temporary operating non-functional mode".  In plain
English (or even plain American) the launch had broken down, but it must
have seemed a little indelicate to say so plainly in such a costly
operation,
</p>

Sometimes I wonder why using imprecise words about a precise situation
is thought to make things better.  When the doctor last told me to hop
on his scales and refrained politely from whistling, I was not in a
state of "Waistline Engirthment Challenge" but Obesity, and only
accepting the hard fact would help.
</p>

<p>
I remember being checked by a friend after I had used the phrase
"Blackest Sin" to describe accurately some awful wrongdoing, because it
could be thought that I was selectively running down men who were
black.  I wonder how he would have got on with the Bible verse which
says "Though your sins are as scarlet, they shall be white as wool".
By my friend's reasoning this could be thought of saying that North
American Indians (the Redskins) are awful and the Palefaces are OK.
That's what it might seem the verse is saying, but the truth is
entirely different.  This Bible verse is not, in fact, saying "things
will get better" but "things will get very much worse", because the
colours described are the early and advanced appearances of a deadly
skin disease: leprosy.
</p>

<p>
So I suppose one could say that Blackskins, Redskins, Whiteskins, and
indeed Allskins are sinners;  and this would neatly fit in with what the
Bible states with emphatic clarity:  "All have sinned and come short of
the glory of God."  And in that state things do not get better, but
disastrously worse.  Unless one takes the remedy, that is.
</p>

<p>
My old Ancestor, William, found the remedy in 1872, and wrote about it
with much joy.  He is much endeared to me because he misunderstood about
the contrast between scarlet and white.  As a wool buyer and blanket
maker, he could clearly see the advantage of the whiteness, and he
realised that this is what a personal acceptance of the death of Jesus
does for one.  It cleans the sin nature right away, and establishes a
person as a son or daughter of God.  It doesn't end there, of course,
because although being a Christian starts as a relationship with Jesus,
it continues as a life-long process.  But William got there - I look
forward to meeting him.
