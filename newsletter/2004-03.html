<h2>Lent</h2>

<p><strong>
Lent is always a difficult time for an Irish Vicar who enjoys rugby
-- first Ireland normally get beaten by England in the Six Nations
[but not this year!] and, secondly, we Irish celebrate St Patrick's
day smack bang in the middle of Lent.  At least if nothing else, the
whole occasion drives me to my knees!
</strong></p><p><strong>
Of course Lent is much more than Rugby and celebrating Saints days
-- it is the season when winter and spring struggle with each other
for dominance.  It ought to be the time when we consider facing up
to the darkness within and exposing it to the light.
</strong></p><p>
It could be the time when we make an honest assessment of ourselves
and the addictions that make us cling to what the world proclaims as
the keys to self-fulfilment: accumulation of wealth;  attainment of
status and admiriation -- what can you add to this list?  I believe
these addictions create expectations that ultimately fail to satisfy
our deepest needs.
</p><p>
Henri Nouwen says that "in these days of increasing addictions, we 
have wandered far away from our Father's home."  He says "The addicted
life is a life lived in a distant country", alluding to the story Jesus
told about the lost son.
</p><p>
The deepest need we have is our desire to be loved, and God the Father
has from the beginning of creation stretched out his arms, never
forcing Himself on anyone.  He waits and hopes that those He has
created will return home so that He can speak words of love to them.
