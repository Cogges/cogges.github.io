<h2>The people I meet</h2>

<br clear="all">

<p><strong>
One of the privileges of ministry is meeting many different people 
from a great variety of walks of life. Part of the role also involves 
listening to people and sharing in their hopes and fears, their pain 
and doubt. All this is very often just under the surface, hidden from 
public view.  I love reading the gospels because they give many 
accounts of interesting people that Jesus met and they had their 
doubts and fears too. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
After Easter we think of Thomas, perhaps unfairly remembered as 
doubting Thomas because of the one occasion when he didn't believe
the disciples when they saw the risen Lord. I have often wondered how 
I would have reacted if I were in his shoes? In the event Jesus came 
to him and showed him the proof he was looking for, the holes in his 
hands and side. Yet I cannot help but feel that doubts and questions 
are a good thing at times. However sure of our beliefs we may be, we 
all have our doubts. This is nothing to be ashamed of, or to fear. 
Rather, God is able to take our questioning and lead us into a deeper 
understanding of himself, his love and his grace. Understood in this 
way we can see that doubt is not the opposite of faith, but rather an 
essential part of our journey.
</strong></p><p>
We may not be able to say with John Newman "Firmly I believe and 
truly..." rather our experience may be nearer to the father of a sick 
child who approached Jesus and said "I believe, help me with my unbelief'.
