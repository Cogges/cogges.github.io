<h2> 11th September </h2>

<p><strong>
For many years we are likely to remember where we were when we heard or
saw the horrific events of Tuesday 11th September in New York and
Washington, just as we remember Dunblane, the news of the death of
Princess Diana, or the assassination of John F Kennedy.
</strong><br clear="all">
</p>

<p>
When I heard the news of the terrorist attacks on New York and
Washington on the radio my first response was disbelief.  Then, as I
watched the video footage of the hijacked plane crashing into the
second tower, and the towers collapsing, my reaction turned to horror.
Having visited Manhattan last summer, and taken the lift to the top of
the World Trade Centre to spend the morning watching the Independence
Day celebrations from this vantage point, I found myself very
personally involved. Horror soon turned to stunned grief as I realised
the magnitude of the attack, and the number of people likely to be
trapped in the buildings and on board the planes. This then became
tinged with fear as friends commented that this could be the beginning
of World War Three.

<pre><em>
Lord, make me an instrument of thy peace.
Where there is hatred, let me sow love;
Where there is injury, pardon;
Where there is discord, union;
Where there is doubt, faith;
Where there is despair, hope;
Where there is darkness, light;
Where there is sadness, joy.

O divine Master, 
Grant that I may not so much seek 
To be consoled as to console, 
To be understood as to understand, 
To be loved as to love; 
For it is in giving that we receive, 
It is in pardoning that we are pardoned, 
It is in dying that we are born to eternal life. 
</em></pre>
</div>

<p>
As my mind ranged through these emotions I found myself almost
constantly praying for the people involved. I was praying for those who
were attempting to escape -- for their protection, for those watching all
that was happening on television who had family and friends who were
trapped -- that they might know God's comfort, and for the American
President and Congress -- that there would be no immediate retaliation.
</p>

<p>
A week later, and I'm still praying. I'm praising God that no
precipitous reprisals have yet been taken. I've heard people say this
is evidence of American weakness, but I consider it strength. I'm
praying for those mourning the loss of loved ones who are known to have
died, for those whose friends or family members are still "missing,
presumed dead", for those whose lives have been broken through
bereavement, injury and fear. I'm praying that love will prevail, that
fear and grief and righteous anger will not prove stronger than love.
And I'm praying for peace in the world, that true justice will be
carried out, and the hatred and disregard for human life that motivated
the terrorists will have no place in the response of America and the
free world.
</p>

<p>
In the Sermon on the Mount Jesus taught, "Love your enemies and pray
for those who persecute you". This seems a very hard request to make
of those whose lives have been so devastated, but I'm praying that God
will enable them to do this -- that love will prove stronger than hate.
Will you join me in prayer for the peace of the world? Perhaps the
prayer attributed to Francis of Assisi who lived in the 12th Century
may help you.
