<h2>On the beginning of hostilities in Iraq</h2>

<p><em>
A Statement from the Bishop of Oxford, the Right Reverend Richard
Harries
</em></p>

<p><strong>
The Prime Minister, after the parliamentary debate and vote, has
authorised British participation in the military action against Iraq.  
Whatever our individual views about the moral legitimacy of this 
action (and there remains considerable doubt within the Church
of England), I invite Christians across the Diocese of Oxford to 
join me in prayer for all those affected by war.
</strong></p><p>
We pray, first, that the war will be quickly over and that both  
military and civilian
casualties will be kept to an absolute minimum;
</p><p>
We pray for the Prime Minister and the leadership of our Armed Forces
who bear
a heavy and difficult responsibility for these awesome decisions, that
all their
actions - both tactical and strategic - may be informed by a concern for
the ordinary
people of Iraq and for the future stability of the region;
</p><p>
We pray for the members of our Armed Forces, and for the Chaplains
ministering
to them, for their safety and for their safe return;
</p><p>
And we pray that a better Iraq will emerge, free of tyranny and with a
democratic
place for all the peoples that live within its borders.
</p><p>
In a situation where power is overwhelmingly on the side of the American
and British
forces, we urge our leaders to conduct this engagement with minimum
necessary force.
</p><p>
We continue to believe that God is ceaselessly at work at every point in
the universe,
working to make something better from the mess we make of things,
drawing some good
out of evil, and healing our broken-ness and division.

You may have been drawn into this conflict because a member of your
family is  deployed in the Gulf.   If you would like us to pray for them
