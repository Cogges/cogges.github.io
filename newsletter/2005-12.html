<h2>Light of the world...</h2>

<p><strong>
I don't know about you, but I've been overwhelmed this year by the
magnitude of suffering in the world.
</strong></p>

<p><strong>
I remember in the <a href="2005-03.html">Easter CrossTalk</a>, trying
to make a response to the suffering we had all witnessed on Boxing Day
last year, when the Tsunami struck.  Since then we've watched
appalling images of starving families in Niger and Malawi.
</strong></p>

<p><strong>
Now we hear the Pakistan authorities have confirmed a death toll of
nearly 80,000 after the terrible earthquake that has devastated the
lives of hundreds of thousands of people.  Closer to home, we
experienced our own vulnerability on a much smaller, but nonetheless
frightening scale, with the London Tube bombings.
</strong></p>

<p>
On a global scale, most of us in the UK remain relatively secure and
indeed remote from the rest of the world's suffering, yet I sense a
general social anxiety about what the future holds.
</p>

<p>
The financial security that my father's generation enjoyed -- retiring
on maximum pension benefits -- is long gone.  Funding for state and
private pensions is unsustainable.  Most endowments, for repaying
mortgage capital, will fail to meet their projected maturity values
and a high proportion of NHS trusts are facing huge budget deficits.
</p>

<p>
My dear doctor friend passed on to me some worrying statistics the
other day -- half the hospital beds in this country are occupied by the
mentally ill; Valium based drugs are the second most prescribed drug
on the NHS; heart disease is set to become the number one killer in
coming years; it's thought that some serious medical conditions have
a stress-related component.
</p>

<p><strong>
I bet you're thinking "some Christmas article this is!"  But please
don't put it down, read on, for there is hope -- great words of hope
spoken to us by Jesus Christ:
</strong></p>

<blockquote><p><em> 
"do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink, is not life
more important than food?  Look at the birds of the air; they do not
reap or sow, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them.  Are you not
much more valuable than they?"
</em></p></blockquote>

<p>
As hard as it might be to believe -- YOU are valuable to God.
</p>

<p>
One of the greatest causes of anxiety is unbelief -- our difficulty in
believing that God cares passionately about us.  At its root lies the
thought that "I matter more to me than I matter to God".
</p>

<p>
The person of little belief has a little God -- too small, they
believe, to care about the details of their lives so that they worry
about them for themselves.  I believe there is an answer to our worry
and anxiety, and it's this -- to stop believing in a man-made lttle
God -- locked up in the wonder of nature, distant and remote from each
of us and to start believing in the real God who comes to us in the
person of Jesus Christ.
</p>

<p>
Once we understand that we are truly valued by God we begin to develop
the capacity to be orientated towards the needs of his world.  Not
only is this God's intention but, amazingly, it liberates us from our
own anxieties and social dis-ease.
</p>

<p>
In this edition of <em>CrossTalk</em> you'll find details of a whole
range of <a href="../xtmas.html">Christmas services</a> and I would
like to take this opportunity to invite you to celebrate the true
meaning of Christmas in your Parish Church.
