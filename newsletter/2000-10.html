<h2>Good Deeds</h2>

<p>
The crested crane is an African bird with beautifully 
coloured feathers and a very elegant walk.  One day a 
crested crane with her beautiful crown raised, met a toad 
wandering along, looking for its lunch. They started to 
talk to each other.  The crested crane began:  "Have you 
noted my elegant beauty, poor toad, and how I have 
been made with such sublime perfections?"  The toad 
looked at the crested crane with pity and replied, "But 
what about your heart?"
</p>

<p>
Many people do good deeds hoping to be well thought 
of by whoever sees them.  But if we want to be 
appreciated by God, we have to be careful of our 
motives.  Indeed good deeds can make the person who 
does them feel good, but in many cases other people do 
not even notice them.  In his powerful Sermon on the 
Mount Jesus puts it strongly:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Be careful not to do your "acts of  
righteousness" before men, to be seen 
by them.  If you do, you will have 
no reward from your Father in heaven. 
(Matthew 6:1)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Do we consider our motives before acting?  Are 
they subjective or objective?  Remember that the 
kind of friend Jesus showed was not the neighbour 
nor the sibling.  The parable of the good Samaritan 
is what it is all about.  A Burundian proverb says, "If 
you scare the baby birds from your crops, your 
child starves". Christian fellowship needs to focus 
on Christian love, the unconditional love which 
always trusts.  Christian fellowship needs to aim 
only at heavenly realms.  Be aware once again that 
giving brings more blessings than receiving.  No 
one can give what he has not got.  But Christian 
love pushes us to understand that we have 
received freely by the grace of our Lord and that we 
ought to give freely.

<h2>Focus on our African Links...</h2>

<p>
As a parish we have two rather different links with 
Africa, one in Burundi and one in the Democratic 
Republic of Congo (DCR) 
</p>

<h3>Link one</h3>

<p>
Pascal Bigirimana studied for two years at Wycliffe Hall in 
Oxford and did part of his training on our parish.  
Pascal lives in Bujumbura, Burundi's capial, with 
his wife and three daughters.  He is the Provincial 
secretary of the Episcopal church in Burundi, 
working directly for the Archbishop of Burundi, and 
divides his time between administrative work, and 
ministry in a new church in a new suburb of 
Bujumbura alongside three lay workers.
</p>

<p>
Burundi, which borders on Rwanda, Uganda, 
Tanzania and the DCR, is a very poor country 
which has recently been racked by intermittent civil 
war and suffering under economic sanctions for 
much of the last forty years.  The people long for a 
lasting peace, and hope that the agreement that 
was signed in Arusha on 28 August this year will 
provide the way forward.
</p>

<h3>Link two</h3>

<p>
The Democratic Republic of Congo has also had 
much internal conflict over the last five years.  Our 
links are with the Ngbaka people in the north west 
of the country.  Primary schools there are in a 
pathetic state with almost nothing to write with 
(imagine learning to write in the sand) and few 
books even for the teachers.
</p>

<p>
Through the "alternative" parties on the 31 October, 
children in the parish and at Blake School have 
collected pencils, pens, rulers etc. to send out to 
the Ngbaka children and have also sent money to 
buy exercise books and literacy books.  This is 
developing into a link with the primary school in 
Bogbaguma.
</p>

<p>
Bogbaguma is a small town of about 5000 people.  
The school has about twelve classes, and there 
may be anything from 20 to 110 children in a class, 
even though the official limit is 55!  The parents 
have to pay (maybe in farm produce) because no 
teacher has received any salary from the 
government for the last four years.  Some teachers 
continued with lessons in the jungle when people 
fled their homes 18 months ago.  That war is over 
now but the Ngbaka people are still rebuilding their 
homes and their lives.
</p>

<p>
Harvest Help - this year the parish will be sending 
money out to buy simple farm tools - spades, forks, 
hoes  etc.   which  are   desperately  needed.       
On 31 October, the children will be collecting seeds 
to send out, so that hopefully each family 
represented at Bogbaguma school will receive a 
packet of seed.
