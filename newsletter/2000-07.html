<h2>Easter in Israel</h2>
</center>

<br clear="all">

<p>
This year, a group of nineteen people, mainly from Cogges, together
with some friends and relatives, spent Easter in the Holy Land. It
was the holiday of a lifetime. We experienced the amazing beauty of
the land - from the picturesque Sea of Galilee in the north to the
rugged desert and Dead Sea further south.
</p>

<p>
We learnt about the lifestyle of people in Bible times, for
example sitting  in a goat's hair tent. We sampled the local
food; for example falafel (made from spicy chick-peas) and
shawarma (a sort of doner kebab, but made with turkey). We met
the people of the land today, both Jews and Palestinians, and
sensed something of the tensions between them, as we passed back
and forth through various checkpoints, but also enjoying their
very real hospitality.
</p>

<p>
But perhaps most important of all, we saw the place of Jesus' death
and resurrection at the very time when the church was celebrating
those saving events. It was a privilege to be in the Church of the
Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem on Easter Day, part of a huge crowd of
people, many locals, but many others from all over the world,
united by one great joy: Christ is risen!
</p>

<p>
A visit to Israel is not a magic spell that will put you in touch
with Jesus Christ. He is risen, and by his Holy Spirit, he is
available to you as Saviour and Friend wherever you are. However, a
visit to Israel can serve as a marvellous visual aid, bringing to
life the people, the places and the story of the Bible.  Those who
shared in the Easter holiday this year will, I am sure, agree that
reading the Bible will never be quite the same again.
