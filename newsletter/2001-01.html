<p>
Because we human beings have ten fingers and thumbs, we count in tens,
and find special significance in multiples of ten. That means we are
fascinated by centenaries, and never more so than this time last year,
as we celebrated the millennium. Of course, there are those who still
maintain that as there was no such date as "the year zero", the real
millennium is now, at the beginning of 2001. So what anniversaries have
we reached at the start of 2001? Two come to mind.
</p>

<p>
First, on January 1st 1801, the Act of Union united Ireland and Britain
to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Of course,
Ireland had been ruled from Britain for a long time before that, but
only then were they united as one nation. We are still citizens of the
"United Kingdom", though since the creation of the Irish Free State
early in the twentieth century, and the Republic of Ireland in 1949,
the Irish part of the Union has consisted of only the six counties of
Northern Ireland.
</p>

<p>
Second, on January 22nd 1901, Queen Victoria died, bringing to an end a
sixty-four year reign -the longest in British history, and the
"Victorian Age."
</p>

<p>
Both anniversaries still exert their influence over modern life. We
continue to search for peace in Northern Ireland, a process full of
highs and lows, progresses and disasters. The concept of "Victorian" is
one that is still familiar to us.  We view it sometimes with approval,
when we think of the great strides made in science, engineering and
commerce; sometimes with disapproval, when we consider what we feel to
have been the over-strict moral codes of the age, or their rather
brutal "restoration" of medieval buildings.
</p>

<p>
Yet for me, the greatest and most important milestone of all remains
the two thousandth anniversary of the birth of Jesus Christ - God
himself coming to earth to experience our life with us, and to die a
saving death for us. It really doesn't matter whether we can pinpoint
the exact date of his birth (though it took place in real historical
time, and we know where and when to within half a decade); what counts
is that his coming still exerts its influence over life today. Our
system of laws began under the direct influence of his teachings. Some
of the greatest philanthropic works of history were inspired by his
Spirit. And he is known and worshipped by millions today who know his
power to forgive and to transform lives.
</p>

<p>
Knowing Jesus Christ is not just about looking to the past; it is also
the key to the future.  It is the key to the problems of Northern
Ireland, and to the ethical and moral maze in which we find ourselves
today.  For the sake of society as well as individuals, Jesus Christ is
the one we need.
</p>

<p>
A very happy new year to you all.
