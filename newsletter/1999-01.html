<H1>999</H1>
</CENTER>

We are now at the start of the last year in the second millennium.
Already millennium mania and some millennium tensions are beginning to
show.  As so many people become strangely obsessed with the fact that
next year ends in 000 it struck me that this year ends in an even more
familiar number - 999.  That number - our code to call for help -
contains in it the heart of the Christian message.<P>

We dial that number in an emergency.  When we need help urgently.  When
we phone, we are asked what service we require.  Each of our possible
answers provides a helpful image of the Bible's message about the
problems of our world.<P>

The police service are called when someone has done something seriously
wrong, when a law has been broken.  The Bible tells us that we have all
failed to be the people God wants us to be.  We have all done things
which are wrong.  We have all broken God's law.  We have - in short -
all sinned.<P>

The fire service are called when someone finds they are faced with an
uncontrollable and dangerous power.  A force which threatens them and
what is previous to them.  Again this fits the Bible's picture.  It
shows us that it is not just that we have sinned.  It sees Sin as a
frightening power.  Something which can take control of our lives and
our societies and destroy us.  We see that today in the damage caused
by drugs or gambling or the arms race or working more and more hours in
order to earn even more money.<P>

The ambulance service are called when someone is suffering and in great
pain.  Once more we know that is often how life is in our world.  The
Bible explains that this is how the world is because people have
disobeyed God and because of the power of Sin in the world.<P>

But what the Bible is most keen to tell us is that there is good news
in these situations.  There is, if you like, a 999 service.  We are not
left on our own to sort out these problems.  We can call for help.
That is because Jesus came to rescue us from all these.  He saves us
from our sins and from God's judgement on them.  He has defeated the
dangerous power of Sin.  He himself has suffered and so he can help us
in our suffering.<P>

One year from now we will be celebrating 2000 years since Jesus'
birth.  How can we best prepare for that in 1<STRONG>999</STRONG>?
Perhaps the best thing would be to recognise the mess we're in, to stop
trying to sort it all out by ourselves, and instead to call for Jesus'
help.  If we do that then we will discover for ourselves what a great
Rescuer he is.<P>
