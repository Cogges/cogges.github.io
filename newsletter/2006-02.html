<h2>Love Luv Love</h2>

<p><strong>
Well it's that time of year again...... the shops are bulging with big
red fluffy cards, small discrete cards, humorous verging on the obscene
cards......all in praise of LOVE.  Yes Valentine's Day approaches!!   For
women it's a very important occasion when the blokes who are sometimes
not the best in the `I love you' stakes...... have the chance to buy a
card and maybe go out for a candlelit meal to make up for things.
</strong></p>

<p><strong>
Relationships and marriage are great.  I am sure we can all think of
people who seem to have `the perfect marriage'.  People are not meant to
live alone ... after all once God had created Adam, he realized he needed
a partner and created Eve out of one of Adam's ribs so the bible says.
You know the humorous response that after God has made Eve she had very
little sleep for the first week. She kept getting up and checking that
Adam still had all his other ribs !!!
</strong></p>

<p><strong>
But is a burst of romance on Valentine's Day really enough?  Look...... I
am not knocking romance, but if the other 364 days of the year are
`loveless' then all the flowers, cards, and meals out in the world  are
not going to be put right on one day.
</strong></p>

<p>
Love is fostered by the acts of kindness, the caring attitude, the
commitment that people give to one another. That's true in friendships
as well  as romantic relationships. As a single person I am so
appreciative of the acts of love my friends offer me.
</p>

<p>
So what's the ideal attitude of love then?
</p>

<p>
At weddings people often use the passage from 1 Corinthians 13 as their
text
</p>

<blockquote><p><em> 
Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast,
it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not
easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.  Love does not delight in
evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts,
always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.
</em></p></blockquote>

<p>
Now that's a set of values to live up to!
</p>

<p>
It seems to me that these values are  really encompassed in one
sentiment of being `unselfish' in our relationships of love with one
another. As naturally self centred humans, that's not easy to do!!
</p>

<p>
I am always so moved by television reports that show acts of self
sacrifice and  love, the events like LIVE 8 that tried to heighten
awareness of the needs of others crippled through debt constraints.
</p>

<p>
I am also moved as a Christian by the act of  love of God who sent Jesus
to die on a cross for us, a painful death, a sacrificial death and a
selfless death. Jesus was God's Valentine card of love to us, Wow!
