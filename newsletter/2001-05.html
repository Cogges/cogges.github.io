<h2> Till death us do part </h2>

<p>
In the marriage service the bride and groom each promise to remain
faithfully together, come what may, until death parts them.  The
minister declares "That which God has joined together, let not man
divide."
</p>

<p>
But how differently most people view marriage today.  Often it's
assumed that if it doesn't satisfy me, I'll just opt out.  Divorce
seems easy but ... even if the couple feel it's the best thing they can
do, people are hurt ... and especially the children.
</p>

<p>
As someone who has enjoyed over 30 years of marriage it seems to me
that society has got the whole basis upside-down.  God made us, and he
designed how our relationships should work, but we are ignoring the
maker's instructions.  Some essentials of the marriage relationship are
being discarded:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Sharing your life with someone will mean you will both need to 
    change - we both had to.
<li>Recognise however that there will always be small things about 
    each other that will not be changed - so learn to live with them.
<li>Ignoring difficulties, not discussing them, is a recipe for disaster
    - keep talking, it's vital.
<li>Sex is God's gift for marriage - but society has rejected that idea 
    as old fashioned.
</ul>

<p>
The Bible teaches that sexual relations unite the couple physically,
emotionally and spiritually.  It says "they will become one flesh".
Today our young people are being encouraged by television soap and
teenage magazines that sexual activity outside marriage, and even
casual sex outside any committed relationship is all right, as long as
it is safe sex - without the possibility of catching a sexually
transmitted disease, or becoming pregnant.  Nobody tells them that it's
unsafe sex as it's damaging their emotions and spirits.  The true
purpose, the great gift of a sexual relationship, that it binds a
married couple together as one flesh for all their lives, is being
ignored and society is suffering as a result.
</p>

<p>
The good news is that God wants the best for our lives and he knows
what is best.  Where we have failed in our relationships God can
forgive us, help us forgive those who have hurt us and enable us to
forgive ourselves.  Ask him into your life and he'll change you.  He'll
help you live according to his instructions.
</p>

<p>
This year at Cogges and South Leigh we have been looking at the maker's
instructions for our lives - so far we've considered marriage, bringing
up children, remaining single and sexuality.  In coming weeks we'll be
looking at money, work, attitudes to government, medical ethics and
other topics that impact our day to day life.  Why don't you join us?
