<h2>What it says in the papers</h2>

<p><strong>
I do look forward, in the morning, to reading the newspaper.  I try 
to maintain political balance by taking the Times, Monday to Saturday, 
and the Observer on a Sunday - and getting annoyed, in equal measure, 
with the views expressed in both.
</strong></p><p><strong>
I particularly enjoy reading Will Hutton who can be incisive and 
irritating in the same sentence. To give you a feel of the quality 
of his writing here is an extract from 2nd May. Let's make this 
interactive.  I've blanked out the name of the institution about 
which he is writing. Can you guess what it is?  
</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>
There was a tradition when I was growing up where my Father would 
take me to the local ??????.  It was an airy building filled with 
light.  When I got my first bike and wanted to roam, my parents could 
not refuse me if I said I was going to the ?????? - a hallowed destination. 
</p><p>
I wanted to keep the tradition going with my own children, but the 
local ?????? does not have the same appeal. They seem dingier; you cannot 
find the ?????? you want; they are peopled by slightly sad, furtive adults
who obviously have some unhealthy obsession or they would not be there. 
You do not stay long; some of the joylessness might rub off. 
</p><p>
So it was no surprise last week to read a report about ?????? indicating 
a precipitous decline in ?????? and predicting that, within 20 years, 
Britain won't have a ?????? 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I would be amazed if you did not conclude that Will Hutton is writing 
about. churches. In fact he was not! The author was commenting on the 
likely fate of our public libraries. 
</p><p>
Everyone keeps telling me that church attendances are in decline. No 
one can doubt the falling figures - but they are an average. I am 
delighted to report that our Church has a growing membership.  The 
question is why?
</p><p>
The challenge is to remain relevant.  People and times move on. Certainly 
the library has adapted - there are now banks of computers with fast 
internet connection. In part we have changed what we do, too.  St Mary's 
Cogges is doing its best to offer a morning service that is relevant and 
rewarding for 21st century worship. We are blessed with some talented 
musicians and every effort is made to make the sermon entertaining as well
as informative. It could be a consequence of our new vicar.  If you have 
not yet met the Reverend Andrew Sweeney, you are missing out on a sunny 
experience. And then there is Junior Church - so many youngsters.
</p><p>
For those of you for whom Sunday morning is a complete no-go-to-church 
area, we understand. The pattern of 1raditional Sundays has changed. That 
is why the Church of England has appointed the Reverend Penny Joyce to 
develop new ways of worship at different times and in different places - 
focused around the Madley Park Community.
</p><p>
Can I end with a challenge and thanks? 
</p><p>
The challenge:  Do not believe everything you read in newspapers.  No way 
is our local library stuffy and staffed by joyless obsessives. For me the 
local library is a fun place to be and somewhere where many parents take 
their children to pass on a first hand love of reading. Similarly a vibrant 
church is one of the best places to be for they literally offer a community 
encounter with God. The challenge?  St Mary's Cogges is an exciting place 
at the moment. Find out for yourself.  Keep an open mind, take a risk, and 
come and see us any Sunday morning - and stay for coffee.
</p><p>
The thanks:  In the life of every community, people come and people move 
on. I would like to record a public thanks to David & Pauline Page who have
now moved to Cardiff after a quarter of a century's work at Cogges. We will 
miss their friendship and support.
