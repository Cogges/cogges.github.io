<h2>The Seasons Turn</h2>

<p>
September again, and is this month an ending or a beginning?

For me an end to our holiday down by Falmouth; for them there in the Fal 
estuary the beginning of the oyster-dredging season with the 'working' 
sailboats.  The end of harvest for the farmers, but the season to sow for 
a new crop. Last of the long School holiday, but a new term to come.
</p> <p>
The Seasons' cycle may be unchanging, but each time around we ourselves 
will have changed -- we are older, wiser we hope, and can reach out for new 
opportunities.  There is always something new to learn, but it should not 
just be facts.  You can know a lot about something, without being active in 
it.  For example, I know a bit about wrought iron, but I have never hammered 
a red-hot bar on a blacksmith's anvil.  On the other hand, I know even more 
about bells, and could happily and successfully ring one in very many 
change-ringing Towers.   That is where true satisfaction lies -- knowledge 
along with involvement.
</p> <p>
It's like that with the Christian life.  Somewhere the Bible says that a 
head full of knowledge about spiritual things just makes you puffed up, and 
that the essence of the Christian life is relationships.  First with God 
through the Lord Jesus Christ, and then with each other.
</p> <p>
Long ages ago God said He was the only one:
"Know and believe me" said God (Is 43, 10)
<br>
"Come to me," said Jesus, meaning, "give me yourself and all your concerns".
<br>
"Follow Me," said Jesus, meaning "show my love to a hurting world".
</p> <p>
Let this autumn be a new 'beginning' not a continuation of an old 'ending'.
