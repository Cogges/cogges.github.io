Imagine there's no heaven <br>
It's easy if you try <br>
No hell below us <br>
Above us only sky <br>
Imagine all the people <br>
Living for today ...<br>
<br>
You may say that I'm a dreamer <br>
But I'm not the only one <br>
I hope some day you'll join us <br>
And the world will live as one.

20 years after his death, John Lennon's song has been 
pronounced the best ever No.1 single. An admirer of Lennon's 
songs myself, I have to confess that this seems to me to be one 
of his most simplistic and I'm surprised at its continuing 
popularity. 
</p>
<p>
However, good song or not, is it a sensible idea to "imagine there's no
heaven"? Given Lennon's limited track record as a prophet (he's the man
who announced in 1972 "Happy Christmas - War is Over") it might seem
strange to take him too seriously. But more and more of us
<span style="text-decoration: underline">are</span> 
turning our backs on all forms of religion and adopting the
materialistic view encouraged by Lennon.
</p>
<p>
Does this result in the gentle happiness that Lennon suggests 
in his song? Recent statistics point to a rise in depression (1 in 
4 of us will become depressed in our lifetime); we have an 
epidemic of stress; violent crime appears to be on the increase 
and there is evidence of widespread dependence on alcohol 
and so-called recreational drugs. These are hardly the 
indicators of a society at ease with itself. 
</p>
<p>
There is also increasing concern at the contemptuous way In 
which we treat other human beings; the bodies of the dead are 
unceremoniously dumped on the floor of an unrefrigerated 
hospital chapel; scientists propose to create embryos solely to 
grow replacement cells for failing bodies; babies are bought and 
sold on the Internet. Little evidence here for the inherent dignity 
of the human being reflected in Lennon's song. 
</p>
<p>
I wonder to what extent the adoption of a materialistic world 
view underlies these developments? Of course, it would be 
foolish to suggest that religion does not have its downside too. 
There are plenty of examples of bigotry, jealousy and downright 
evil perpetrated in the name of religious belief. But are we 
risking throwing out the baby with the bath water? 
</p>
<p>
As a sociologist, I note that the majority of societies in the past 
have been knit together by a religious view of the world that 
provides a framework of meaning that lifts our eyes from the 
narrow pursuit of our own interests to the concerns of others. 
Maybe religion is an essential part of a truly human way of life. 
</p>
<p>
Of course, as a Christian, I want to go much further than that 
and say that such a religious world view is not just necessary 
but true, and all the more necessary because it is true. As the 
Psalmist put it: 
</p>
<div align="center"><em>
"What is man that you [God] are mindful of him, <br>
The son of man that you care for him <br>
You made him a little lower than the heavenly beings <br>
And crowned him with glory and honour."
</em></div>
<p><strong>
Now that's worth imagining!
