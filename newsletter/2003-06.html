<h2>Community</h2>

<p><strong>
I know this may be pushing things a little too far - but just
imagine, for a moment if you can, that your Parish church was
simply the best place to be - a place where the whole community
could meet, enjoy one another's company,
establish friendships and have a real sense of belonging. Would
this be a place which you might want to be a part of?  Well,
this is the sort of picture that stirs my imagination and, as a
Vicar, sets my pulse racing.
</strong></p><p><strong>
I would say, humbly, that it excites God too because his aim in
human history is the creation of an inclusive community of
loving people, with himself as its primary sustainer and most
glorious inhabitant.
</strong></p><p>
There's a little book called 'The All Better Book', in which
young children try to solve the world's knottiest problems:
what to do about the ozone layer, how to eradicate poverty! But
by far the toughest question is this: How could we figure out a
system where no one is lonely? Listen to some of the children's
remarkable responses:
</p><p>
"Make food that talks to you when you eat. For instance, it
would say, "How are you doing?" and "What happened to you
today?" (Max aged 9)
</p><p>
By far the most touching was this one from Brian aged 8, "Sing
a song. Stamp your feet. Read a book" (Sometimes I think no one
loves me, so I do one of these).
</p><p>
I believe that community is what we have been created for - it
is certainly God's desire for life and an indispensable
condition for human flourishing. Some statistics have proved
that people who have poor health habits but strong social ties
lived significantly longer than people who had great health
habits but were isolated. As Christian author, John Ortberg
says, "It is better to eat deep fried crisps with good friends
than to eat broccoli alone!"
</p><p>
I've been here just a year now and my passion, along with many
members of the Church, is to develop a pastoral policy that
demonstrates the love of God (the Christmas chocolate was an
attempt to do that).
</p><p>
I did say in a previous article that I would be only too happy
to visit you or meet with you. From July, I aim to hold two
pastoral surgeries on the second and fourth Tuesdays of the
month. Please, if you would like to talk, then just phone the
Parish Office and make an appointment. It could be for a
wedding or baptism or just for a chat.
