### The Parenting Course
Children do not arrive with an instruction manual, yet no role we undertake is more important than parenting.
This 6 week course is for any parents, step-parents or carers of children aged 2-10.
Discover that we are not alone in the challenges we face and pick up ideas from other parents. Practical talks are followed by group discussion in a relaxed atmosphere.  Topics covered include meeting our children's needs, setting boundaries and teaching healthy relationships.
