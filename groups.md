We warmly invite you to join one of our Connect groups. Connect groups meet mid-week in the relaxed atmosphere of members’ own homes. Activities include worship, bible study, prayer for each other and the wider world, and socials.

Connect groups offer an environment of friendship and trust where we can support and encourage each other in our wholehearted devotion to Jesus Christ. We try to look outwards as well as inwards as we seek to put the gospel into practice in our lives.

If you would like to join one of our groups, please contact Rich White:
rich@coggesparish.com or Sue Kirby: sue.kirby@coggesparish.com or telephone
the Church Office on: 01993 779 613.
