We warmly invite you to join one of our Connect groups.

Connect groups meet mid-week in the relaxed atmosphere of members' own homes. Activities include worship, Bible study, prayer for each other and the wider world, and also social events. Connect groups offer an environment of friendship and trust where we can support and encourage each other in our wholehearted devotion to Jesus Christ.  We try to look outwards as well as inwards as we seek to put the gospel into practice in our lives.

If you would like to join one of our groups, please contact the group leader or Jane Harper.

### Monday morning

We meet each week and concentrate on intercessory prayer for people and events in our locality and the nation.

Leader: Gill Curwood.    Weekly, 10:30am.    Venue: Newland Mill.

### Monday evening

The group currently consists of those who are Christians who value their Anglican heritage. They want to continue exploring their faith through Bible study using challenging materials to promote lively and meaningful discussions.

The members identify with St. Mary's, Cogges, as a parish church which serves the whole community. They are committed to expressing their Christian life through service to others either in the congregation, the parish or the wider community. The members support each other and others through prayer and offer care support to one another in good times and bad.

### The Work Place - Supporting & Equipping Christians At Work

This group will seek to equip and support you and your partner in the place of work and the demands and challenges this places on your work-life balance.

We will meet at times helpful to the demands of those who wish to receive support from such a group. This may reflect a  flexibility of both time and place to meet the needs of those wishing to be involved. Again that flexibility should not restrict you to being committed to every time we meet but we would encourage all members of the church family who are in work to see this as a place of support and equipping at any time.  The work place is a place of mission.

For many it is your calling in Christ.

Leaders: Stuart and Sissel Harrison.
