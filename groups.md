We warmly invite you to join one of our Connect groups.

Connect groups meet mid-week in the relaxed atmosphere of members' own homes. Activities include worship, Bible study, prayer for each other and the wider world, and also social events. Connect groups offer an environment of friendship and trust where we can support and encourage each other in our wholehearted devotion to Jesus Christ. We try to look outwards as well as inwards as we seek to put the gospel into practice in our lives.

If you would like to join one of our groups, please contact the group leader or Mari Graves.


### Barbara Eaton (Tuesday am) Cogges Hill Road. 

The group currently consists of those who are Christians who value their Anglican heritage. They want to continue exploring their faith through Bible study using challenging materials to promote lively and meaningful discussions.
The members identify with St. Mary’s, Cogges, as a parish church which serves the whole community. They are committed to expressing their Christian life through service to others either in the congregation, the parish or the wider community. The members support each other and others through prayer.

### Alan and Jill Elson (Tuesday) Woodstock Road

Our Connect group is a place where we gather to meet with God and one another, through worship, exploring the Bible and praying together. We want to listen to God and listen to one another. We are excited about developing our friendships, coming alongside one another in the highs and lows of everyday life and encouraging one another to explore what God has for each of us. This will be a starting point for sharing our lives in practical ways. Looking outwards, group meals and other social activities may be ways of sharing our life in God with others. 


### Paul and Mari Graves (Tuesday) Central Witney

In our group we love to worship God and explore His word together. We enjoy sharing our lives and expect to support one another in prayer. We encourage and equip one another for our witness to the wider world. We plan to organise an event each term to make our faith more accessible to our friends and neighbours.
Normally we meet fortnightly at 7.00pm to share supper, followed at 8.00pm by worship, Bible study and prayer.

### Malcolm and Jane Harper (Tuesday) Central Witney

### Roger and Jean Howell (Thursday) Burwell Meadow

Our aims are:
