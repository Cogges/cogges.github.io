<TD><B>We have tried to make using this web site of the transcriptions as intuitive as possible. These few notes should help you to get the best out of it.</B>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2"><B>System Requirements</B></FONT> are a PC with any reasonably up-to-date web browser. The layout has been optimised for a screen resolution of 1024 x 768, but you should get perfectly acceptable results at other resolutions.

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2"><B>A Navigation Bar</B></FONT> at the top of most pages lets you move between the transcriptions of individual graves, the <B>Index</B> and the <B>Area Plan</B> of the churchyard. When viewing a page, the <B>Next &gt;</B> and <B>&lt; Prev.</B> links let you step to the adjacent graves in the numbering sequence.

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2"><B>The Plan of the Churchyard</B></FONT> is initially shown at low magnification to give an overview of the whole churchyard, with the separate areas shown in different colours. If you click in any area, you will get a magnified view of that area, showing individual graves. Scroll bars in your browser window, allow you to view the whole area.

<P>
By clicking on an individual grave number, you will be taken straight to that grave. (Note that on some small graves, the number is placed beside the outline of the grave rather than inside it. In every case, it is the number you should click on, not the outline of the grave).

<P>
If you want to find other graves in the same area, you will find it best to use the <B>MI Plan</B> link to return to that plan. This will take you back to the magnified plan. Alternatively if you use the <B>Area Plan</B> link on the navigation bar, you will be taken back to the overview plan.

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2"><B>The Index of Names</B></FONT> provides the easiest way to get to a specific person's grave. Simply clicking on the grave number in the right hand column will take you straight there.

<P>
If you want to find other members of the same family, you will find it best to use your browser's <B>Back</B> button, to return to the Index of Names. This will take you back to your previous location in the index. Alternatively if you use the <B>Index</B> link on the navigation bar, you will be taken back to the start of the index.

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2"><B>You can Magnify</B></FONT> most of the pictures, by clicking on the image. This will produce a page containing just the picture, at its full magnification. To return to the normal inscription page, you may either click on the <B>Back</B> link, use your  browser's <B>Back</B> button, or simply click on the magnified image.
