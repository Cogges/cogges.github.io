<B>South Leigh is first mentioned in 1190 as Stanton Lega. Stan-ton...  Stone town (near
<BR>Devil's Quoits prehistoric stone circle), Leigh, - Lega... forest clearing (in Wychwood
<BR>Forest). 
<BR>The oldest visible part of St James's Church is 12<SUP>th</SUP> Century and the renowned mediaeval wall
<BR>paintings date from the 15<SUP>th</SUP> century. John Wesley preached his first sermon there in 1725.
<BR>South Leigh remained a chapelry of Stanton Harcourt until 1868, when a separate parish was created.
<BR>The first vicar, Gerard Moultrie, helped establish a National School (now the Village Hall, No 1) in
<BR>1871. It closed in 1946. He also built Glebe House (No 8) and St James's College, later Holyrood
<BR>House (No 3).
<BR>The Wesleyan Chapel was built in 1876 (No 10)
<BR>At least two cottages (Nos 15 & 16) in the village retain smoke-blackened thatch, a rare survival
<BR>indicating that they were originally constructed without a chimney, smoke escaping through the roof.
<BR>Agricultural history is one of mixed farming with many families working on the land until the 1970s.
<BR>For at least five hundred years, owners of South Leigh have been absentee landlords, so all the land
<BR>has been managed by tenant farmers.
<BR>Parliamentary Enclosure of the land was completed in 1792 and landholders from 1792 to 1875 were
<BR>the Sibthorp Family, and from 1875 the Mason Family and Brasenose College.
<BR>When farming was in recession in the 1860s - 70s twelve families, one third of the population,
<BR>emigrated to New Zealand.
<BR>The Sibthorp owners built several pairs of model family cottages (e.g. No 18) and invested in new
<BR>farm buildings during the 1870s.
<BR>The Railway Station opened in 1861 and closed to passengers in 1962 and to freight in 1965.
<BR>Twenty-one men from the village lost their lives, whilst on active service, during the two World Wars.
<BR>The poet Dylan Thomas lived at the Manor House (No 7), 1947-1949.
<BR>The major addition to the village during the 20<SUP>th</SUP> century was Lymbrook Close in the 1950s, built on
<BR>pasture land known as Bird's Hay.
<BR>The population in Jan 2000 was 349, and most residents now commute to work in Witney, Eynsham,
<BR>Oxford and London.
