St Mary's Cogges, Witney is one of the newest New Wine Discipleship Year training centres.

The Discipleship Year for 18-24 year-olds will take you on a life-changing journey of discovery and adventure. You’ll be inspired, get some ‘hands-on’ Kingdom experience, and will have a lot of fun along the way – all with a great group of people.

## The year

You’ll receive 8 hours a week of core teaching on subjects such as Jesus, the Bible, the kingdom of God, mission and evangelism, leadership and character development. You’ll learn from some inspirational leaders from both the church and business world, all of whom have a wealth of experience of growing God’s kingdom in the community, culture and commerce contexts.

In turn, we ask you to commit to 12 hours a week serving in St Mary’s, Cogges where you will get to exercise your growing leadership in areas such as kids work, youth work, serving the poor, family ministries, evangelism, worship and prayer/prophetic ministry. Or it is also possible to have a placement at the charity, Viva Network. There are options on an overseas missions trip in the year and weekends away. You will also be serving on a team at one of the new wine summer conferences.

## Accommodation and cost

You’ll need to find your own accommodation locally. We may be able to offer accommodation in family homes. Typically you will need to find some part time work to cover living expenses, there is the possibility of a part time job with Open Doors, the charity working with the persecuted church, in customer service or events planning areas. 

Fees are £980 per person, payable at the start of the course.
