### Weekend Away 2015 - 26th - 28th June
We will be having a Church family weekend away in June, to the beautiful Windmill Farm Conference Centre. We would love everyone who can, to come and join in the fun! 

We especially want all our teams to have a rest and play together and our whole church family to have fun - and that includes you!

Here is a taster of some of the things we might be doing:

Games, films, bonfire, seminars, craft, lots of eating, praying, talent night, laughing, worship, children's events, listening to talks, relaxing, walking, talking, marshmallows, climbing wall, hog roast, biking, singing....

At the moment we are putting together the costs for the weekend as we want to make it as affordable as possible.  It would really help us if we could have an expression of interest from you.

Please click here and let us know if you would like to come.
