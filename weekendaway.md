### Weekend Away 2015 - 26th - 28th June

We will be having a Church family weekend away in June, to the beautiful Windmill Farm Conference Centre. We would love everyone who can, to come and join in the fun! 

We especially want all our teams to have a rest and play together and our whole church family to have fun - and that includes you!

Here is a taster of some of the things we might be doing:

Games, films, bonfire, seminars, craft, lots of eating, praying, talent night, laughing, worship, children's events, listening to talks, relaxing, walking, talking, marshmallows, climbing wall, hog roast, biking, singing....

### Booking

You will need to book an event ticket for each person in your party.
This event is fully catered and all your meals will be included in the price of your stay. If you have any special dietary or mobility requirements please email the office. We've tried really hard to keep the costs as low as possible that includes ticket processing costs. That does mean that many of you will need to make multiple payments (but it will save you about Â£5!) All tickets must be purchased online, no offline purchases (sorry again).

We are looking forward to welcoming you to Windmill Farm on Friday 26th June!

### How to buy your tickets

Please read each of the three steps carefully: (see the worked examples at the bottom for more information)

### 1. I want to book a room in the Conference Centre:
  
    If for any reason a suitable room is not available and you are disappointed about not finding one, please let the office know and you can be on a waiting list for cancellations. 

Purchase on our [Eventbrite site](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/cogges-weekend-away-tickets-3641901024). Rooms are booked separately, you still need to purchase an event ticket.

### 2. I want to camp 

    Please note there will be no electrical hook up available but all meals are provided in the cost of your event ticket.  

How many people are there in your family, excluding pre-schoolers? *(your pre-school children will need separate tickets)* Pick the Camping ticket package below that matches your family.
