St Mary's Cogges is an evangelical Anglican church serving the east side of the thriving town of Witney in West Oxfordshire. Establishing and maintaining community is fundamental to our vision - "making Christ known by word and deed".

Through a range of modern and traditional services, together with a flourishing children's and young people's work, we offer opportunities for celebration and for sharing the good news of Jesus Christ - "the same, yesterday, today and forever".
