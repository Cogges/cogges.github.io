#### Public Transport
The nearest train station is Hanborough.  From there you need to have pre-booked a taxi or get the 233 bus from outside the station to Witney Town Cen tre.  Alternatively get a train from Oxford then catch the S1 bus to Witney from Fridewide Square opposite the station.

Please note that public transport from Witney Town Centre to the venue is difficult and we recommend travelling by car if at all possible.
