contact_bio: "Nick is a self – supporting curate (that means unpaid!) working across all three parishes, but with a particular commitment to St. James, South Leigh. Married to Heather and with 4 grown up children, Nick has lived in Witney for nearly 40 years and for most of that time has been in a leadership role either at Cogges or South Leigh (or both!).  He has done most things in the two churches except being churchwarden or treasurer, and for 24 years was a Licensed Lay Minister. He was ordained in 2012, leads worship and preaches, mainly at South Leigh, and has an oversight responsibility for safeguarding and pastoral care and anything else Simon asks him to. He supports his ministry by working as a senior lecturer in social work at Oxford Brookes University specialising in child welfare and child protection. He relaxes by reading improving texts of theology and spirituality (at least that’s what he’s told the Bishop - and definitely not historical detective fiction)."
