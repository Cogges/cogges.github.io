_Enabling people to pray, give and go in our local community and further afield._ 

At Cogges we take seriously the call to be part of God’s world-wide church and also Jesus’ great commission to go and make disciples of all nations (Matthew 28). As a result we tithe our income and give this money to help the work of individuals and organisations in our local community and across the world. We also look to encourage people to see if God is calling them to the mission field and help them as they explore that calling. Take a look below to see some of the individuals and organisations we support.

### Making an impact through social action 

- *Besom* – provides a bridge between those who want to give time, money, things, or skills and those who are in need. Volunteers deliver donated food and goods www.besom.com 
- *CAP Debt Centre* – provides advice to those who are struggling with debt www.capuk.org 

### Impacting the next generation 

- *Adventure+* - encourages young people to live life to the full through outdoor adventure and education [www.adventureplus.org.uk](www.adventureplus.org.uk)

"Going to Malawi gave me the opportunity to share my talents with others which was such a joy and privilege for me to do and to see so many smiles. From my most recent trip the thing that has challenged me the most is the attitude of the long term missionaries out there. In their ministry they are not only working so hard to bless the local people, paying such care to ensure the work they do is culturally appropriate and sustainable, but have decided to use their time in Malawi to minister to people like me, investing what they have learned into others. I feel challenged as to how I can approach my life in this way. " 


### Impacting the Persecuted Church 

- *Open Doors* – work in many countries supporting Christians who are persecuted for their faith [www.opendoorsuk.org](www.opendoorsuk.org)
- *Dave and Ali Laithwaite* – short term mission with The Messengers

“They had so little, yet their hospitality was incredible, they were such beautiful, gentle, loving people who shone with the love of Jesus. We went to teach and encourage them, yet we left so much richer in our hearts, having learnt so much from them and been mightily encouraged.”

### Impacting us as a church 

*Gasenyi, Burundi*
We established a link with Gasenyi Parish back in 1996 and in 2015 formalised this link on the request of the Bishop there. Beginning with a prayer link, we are excited to see how this will develop in the future and how we can learn from one another.
