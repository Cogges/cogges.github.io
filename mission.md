_Enabling people to pray, give and go in our local community and further afield._ 

At Cogges we take seriously the call to be part of God’s world-wide church and also Jesus’ great commission to go and make disciples of all nations (Matthew 28). As a result we tithe our income and give this money to help the work of individuals and organisations in our local community and across the world. We also look to encourage people to see if God is calling them to the mission field and help them as they explore that calling. Take a look below to see some of the individuals and organisations we support.

### Making an impact through social action 

- *Besom* – provides a bridge between those who want to give time, money, things, or skills and those who are in need. Volunteers deliver donated food and goods www.besom.com 
- *CAP Debt Centre* – provides advice to those who are struggling with debt [www.capuk.org](http://www.capuk.org) 

### Impacting the next generation 

- *Adventure+* - encourages young people to live life to the full through outdoor adventure and education [www.adventureplus.org.uk](http://www.adventureplus.org.uk)

*Tom says:* 90% of students who go to University in England do not love Jesus. Of the 10% that do, 95% of them lose their faith while at University. Reaching out to these students and letting them know that they are unconditionally loved by a very real God is so, so important. Canvas changed my life and I am so excited to see how God uses me to impact the lives of students in Birmingham over the next 2 years!


### Impacting the Persecuted Church 

- *Open Doors* – work in many countries supporting Christians who are persecuted for their faith [www.opendoorsuk.org](http://www.opendoorsuk.org)

*Scheilla says:* I thank you for your support, in helping me you helped a thousand people, you saved so many lives because any time I treat a patient and he is healed there is your contribution. Thank you again for the seed you sow in me. I hope the fruits will continue to multiply.


### Impacting us as a church 

*Gasenyi, Burundi* We established a link with Burundi back in 1996 and in 2014 formalised a link with Gasenyi Parish in the Diocese of Bujumbura on the request of the Bishop there. Beginning with a prayer link, we are excited to see how this will develop in the future and how we can learn from one another.

Learning how the church in Gasenyi blesses their community:
With funds from our 2015 harvest offering, the Diocese of Bujumbura is setting up a herb garden project in Gasenyi to improve nutrition. The local diet lacks essential minerals. Plots of land are very small, so people lack the space to grow sufficient vegetables. A new plant nursery based in the parish is cultivating amaranth herbs. The aim is to establish 80 small kitchen gardens for those particularly at risk and provide the necessary gardening and nutritional training.
