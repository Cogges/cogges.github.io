###Expresso Breakfast
Expresso Breakfast provides a welcoming and relaxed setting for women of any age to enjoy food, conversation and an inspirational short talk.  The breakfasts are held three times a year on a Saturday morning.


###Create for Christmas
Create for Christmas is an evening for women held each year in early December.  We invite women into the church to make various crafts such as Wreath rings and Christmas decorations. 'Experts' provide demos and offer a helping hand so that everyone can enjoy making something. We serve mulled wine and warm fruit punch.  For many women it is their first visit to the church and they comment on the lovely atmosphere and warm welcome.
