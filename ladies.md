### Create for Summer
This is a new event where women can meet up to enjoy making some stunning crafts such as glass painting, flower arrangements, canvas wall art and jewellery making.  A relaxed evening with Pimms and party bites!

### Create for Christmas
Create for Christmas is an evening for women held each year in early December.  We invite women into the church to make various crafts such as Wreath rings and Christmas decorations. 'Experts' provide demos and offer a helping hand so that everyone can enjoy making something. We serve mulled wine and warm fruit punch.  For many women it is their first visit to the church and they comment on the lovely atmosphere and warm welcome.
