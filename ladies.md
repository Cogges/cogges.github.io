### Expresso Breakfast
Expresso Breakfast provides a welcoming and relaxed setting for women of any age to enjoy food, conversation and an inspirational short talk.  The breakfasts are held three times a year on a Saturday morning.

### Create for Summer (Thurs 19th June 2014 at 7.30pm)
This is a new event where women can meet up to enjoy making some stunning new crafts.  There will be glass painting, flower arrangements and canvas wall art as well as beautiful makes from 'Makeve'. A relaxed evening with Pimms and party bites!


### Create for Christmas
Create for Christmas is an evening for women held each year in early December.  We invite women into the church to make various crafts such as Wreath rings and Christmas decorations. 'Experts' provide demos and offer a helping hand so that everyone can enjoy making something. We serve mulled wine and warm fruit punch.  For many women it is their first visit to the church and they comment on the lovely atmosphere and warm welcome.
