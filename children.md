###Children's Church
Children's Church is for children, 0-11yrs, who meet on Sunday mornings at St Mary's during the 9.30am & 11am services.  There are 5 age-specific groups where we teach the children the basics of the Christian faith and encourage them in their own faith, through games, crafts, stories and other fun activities.

###Toddler Group
A friendly group for all Mums, Dads and carers of pre-school aged children. Tuesday afternoons from 1.30 - 3pm in the Church Centre, term time only.
Bring your babies and toddlers to play inside and outside (weather permitting!). We provide snacks and drinks for adults & children, run a craft activity and do some singing.
We also have a short and fun service for the children in the church on the first Tuesday of every month at 2pm.

###X:site
An event for all 7-11 year olds in the West Oxfordshire area. Every 2 months on a Saturday evening (6-8pm) usually held at St Mary's, Church Green, Witney.
Each event combines silly games, live music with a great band, videos, creative prayer, craft, drama, Bible stories and lots more so that everyone can have a good time, learn about Jesus and have fun at the same time! They have such a great time that they invite their friends to come too.

It is organised by a partnership of local churches (including St Mary's Cogges) in the West Oxfordshire area and Scripture Union.
