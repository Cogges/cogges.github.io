St Mary's Church and the Cogges Church Centre are in Church Lane, Witney, next door to the Cogges Manor Farm Museum (follow the brown road signs pointing to disabled access to the museum). The church can be reached on foot from central Witney using the Crown Lane footpath near the Windrush Leisure Centre.
