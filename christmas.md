We have enjoyed an encouraging year at St Mary’s Cogges, new members have joined us and lives have been changed as we’ve spent time together discovering more about God’s love for us and His world.

Please do come and join us at one of our Christmas services as we celebrate the birth of Jesus and His light coming into the world to drive away darkness and fear.

We hope that you and those you love have a peaceful and blessed Christmas.
