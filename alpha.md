* Who is Jesus?
* How do I pray?
* Why is there suffering?
* What about the church?

Do these kinds of questions bug you? Then the Alpha course is just for you.

### The Alpha course

The Alpha course is for those with questions about Christianity, the meaning of life and everything. It starts with an Alpha Launch Party including music, food and a talk, and then runs over 8 to 10 weeks in smaller groups. We have daytime groups and evening groups meeting in a home, for food, talk and discussion. 

Our current Alpha course starts with the Alpha Launch Party on Friday 12th September, 7.30pm in the Church. Invite friends/relatives/neighbours for a great evening with good food and good company. Plus it’s all Free!
