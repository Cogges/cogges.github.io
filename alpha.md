* Who is Jesus?
* How do I pray?
* Why is there suffering?
* What about the church?

Do these kinds of questions bug you? Then the Alpha course is just for you.

## The Alpha course

The Alpha course is for those with questions about Christianity, the
meaning of life and everything.  It starts with an introductory supper
including music, food and good company, and then runs over 8 to 10
weeks.  A typical evening starts with a hot meal, and then a short
talk on a key aspect of the Christian faith such as "Why did Jesus
die?" or "How can we have faith?", and finally a group session to ask
questions.

Our current Alpha course started on 1st October (after an introductory
supper on Friday 20th September) and meets on Tuesday evenings.
