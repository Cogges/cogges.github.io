* Who is Jesus?
* How do I pray?
* Why is there suffering?
* What about the church?

Do these kinds of questions bug you? Then the Alpha course is just for you.

## The Alpha course

The Alpha course is for those with questions about Christianity, the meaning of life and everything. We are not currently running an Alpha course but expect to run another course in the autumn of 2013.

The Alpha course starts with an introductory supper including music, food and good company.

The Alpha course is then run over 10 weeks. A typical evening starts with a hot meal, and then a short talk on a key aspect of the Christian faith such as, Why did Jesus die? or How can we have faith?, and finally a group session to ask questions.

### Find out more

If you would prefer a course before September, you may find a course at another church in the area.
