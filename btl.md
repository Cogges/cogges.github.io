### Beyond the Lychgate
Reaching, Resourcing & Supporting the Cogges Community

Expanding our mission footprint 
These new facilities will enable us to develop how we serve the needs of local families and their children, through a number of possible activities including the pre-school group, an after-school club, a youth club and new facilities for Messy Church. On Sundays the larger spaces possible in the new building will provide our Junior Church with the space they need to flourish.  Through our church’s mission planning we have identified possible opportunities: to serve young people, including those who ‘hang out’ in the churchyard, to provide a drop-in centre for young people and adults with special needs, to offer activities and support for the lonely and elderly of the parish.
