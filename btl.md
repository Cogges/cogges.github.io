### Reaching, Resourcing & Supporting the Cogges Community

These new facilities will enable us to develop how we serve the needs of local families and their children, through a number of possible activities including the pre-school group, an after-school club, a youth club and new facilities for Messy Church. On Sundays the larger spaces possible in the new building will provide our Junior Church with the space they need to flourish.

It's time to become active and support this project. Please pray about what you feel God is asking you to give, either as a  one-off gift, monthly giving, or both. You can download the pledge form here.

For any further information on giving please contact Keith Harwood on 01993 779613.

    We now face a timely opportunity to create a legacy that will transform the kind of service we offer to 
    local people now and for many years to come.
