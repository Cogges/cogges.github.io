If you have newly moved to the Cogges area, or are not connected to any local church, you are warmly invited to join us at any of our Sunday services at St Mary's Church, Cogges.

### 8.00AM HOLY COMMUNION
This is a reflective service of Holy Communion following the Book of Common Prayer. There is a short sermon but no hymns. On the first Sunday each month, the service is followed by "Coffee and Croissants" in the Church Centre.

### 9.15AM MORNING WORSHIP WITH BAPTISM (3rd Sunday each month)
Visitors are always welcome at the all age service on the 3rd Sunday each month, which includes a Baptism or a service of Thanksgiving for the birth of a child. Coffee and cake will be served at the end of the service.

### 10.30AM MORNING WORSHIP
This Service includes a mixture of modern and traditional music, scripture readings, preaching and prayer. Junior Church for children meets in the Church Centre throughout the service and begins with a time of free play.  Holy Communion is celebrated on the second Sunday of the month. Tea and coffee, served in the Church Centre after the service, provide an opportunity to get to know people.

### 6.30PM EVENING SERVICE
The Evening Service includes an extended time of informal worship, teaching and an opportunity to receive prayer.   
On the 4th Sunday of the month (usually) it is a Celebration Service with a Guest Speaker.
