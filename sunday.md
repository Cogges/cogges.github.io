If you have newly moved to the Cogges area, or are not connected to any local church, you are warmly invited to join us at any of our Sunday services at St Mary's Church, Cogges.


### 8.00am Holy Communion

This is a quiet service of Holy Communion following the Book of Common Prayer. There is a short sermon but no hymns. On the first Sunday each month, the service is followed by "Coffee and Croissants" in the Church Centre.

### 9:30am Family Worship

Visitors are especially welcome at this family service (on the 3rd Sunday each month), particularly those coming for a Baptism or for a service of Thanksgiving for the birth of a child. Coffee and cake will be served at the end of the service.

### 11.00am Morning Worship

This is St Mary's main service of the day, with a mixture of modern and traditional music, scripture readings, preaching and prayer. Children leave for Junior Church after an opening time together (except when it is a Family service, usually on the third Sunday of the month). Holy Communion is celebrated on the second Sunday of the month. Tea and coffee, served in the Church Centre after the service, provide an opportunity to get to know people.

### Evening Services

On the first Sunday each month at 6:00pm there is a service of Evening Prayer (from the Book of Common Prayer). There is a quarterly healing service (at 7:30pm) on a third or fifth Sunday (details will be in the weekly Update). A new Celebration Service will start on Sunday 23rd June (at 7:00pm), followed by the 4th Sundays in September, October and November.
