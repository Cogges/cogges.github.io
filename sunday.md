If you have newly moved to the Cogges area, or are not connected to any local church, you are warmly invited to join us at any of our Sunday services at St Mary's Church, Cogges.

### 8.00AM HOLY COMMUNION
This is a reflective service of Holy Communion following the Book of Common Prayer. There is a short sermon but no hymns. On the first Sunday each month, the service is followed by "Coffee and Croissants" in the Church Centre.

### 9:30AM MORNING WORSHIP
This Service is a slightly shorter version of the 11am Service. Visitors are always welcome and often attend the family service (on the 3rd Sunday each month), which may include a Baptism or a service of Thanksgiving for the birth of a child. Coffee and cake will be served at the end of the family service.

### 11.00AM MORNING WORSHIP
This Service includes a mixture of modern and traditional music, scripture readings, preaching and prayer. Children leave for Junior Church after an opening time together (except when it is a Family service, usually on the third Sunday of the month). Holy Communion is celebrated on the second Sunday of the month. Tea and coffee, served in the Church Centre after the service, provide an opportunity to get to know people.

### EVENING SERVICES
Most months we hold Celebration Services with extended informal worship and Guest Speakers from around the country. These take place at 7:00pm and are usually on the 4th Sunday of the month.

On the first Sunday of each month at 6:00pm there is a service of Evening Prayer (from the Book of Common Prayer). There is a quarterly healing service at 7:00pm (details will be in the weekly Update).

If you have newly moved to the Cogges area, or are not connected to any local church, you are warmly invited to join us at any of our Sunday services at St Mary's Church, Cogges.
