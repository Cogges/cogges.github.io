### The Parenting Course
Children do not arrive with an instruction manual, yet no role we undertake is more important than parenting.
These courses are for any parents, step-parents or carers who want to discover that we are not alone in the 
challenges we face, pick up ideas from other parents and learn how to make even the happiest family better. 

The Parenting Children Course and The Parenting Teenagers Course:

    Dates: TBC - please contact the Church Office for more info
