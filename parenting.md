### The Parenting Course
Children do not arrive with an instruction manual, yet no role we undertake is more important than parenting.
These courses are for any parents, step-parents or carers who want to discover that we are not alone in the 
challenges we face, pick up ideas from other parents and learn how to make even the happiest family better. 

Local churches are running both the 
[Parenting Children](http://www.relationshipcentral.org/parenting-children-course) and 
[Parenting Teenagers](http://www.relationshipcentral.org/parenting-teenagers-course) Courses 
on Mondays, 13 Oct - 24 Nov 2014, 7.45-9.30pm, Open Doors Conference Room, Range Road, Witney. 
Registration is Â£10 per person. Booking & details: Judith Ledden, 07706 250 260 or
