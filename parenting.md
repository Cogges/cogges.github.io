### The Parenting Course
Children do not arrive with an instruction manual, yet no role we undertake is more important than parenting.
These courses are for any parents, step-parents or carers who want to discover that we are not alone in the 
challenges we face, pick up ideas from other parents and learn how to make even the happiest family better. 

The Parenting Children Course and The Parenting Teenagers Course:

    Dates (provisional): Mondays 12th and 19th Oct, 2nd, 9th, 16th and 23rd Nov 
    Time: 7.30pm
    Venue: TBD
    Cost: Â£10 per person
