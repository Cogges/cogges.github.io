# Generous Giving
* A priority rather than about ‘spare change’
* Prayerful an act of worship and thanksgiving
* Planned but not prescriptive
* Proportionate realistic to our income
* Communal for the needs of others and with others for a common purpose
* Sacrificial reflected in our lifestyles
* Cheerful given as an offering to God
