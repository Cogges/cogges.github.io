![Bacon](/images/bacon.jpg)
Join us for a bacon butty and a thought for the day. Wear your old clothes because at 9.30am we’re going to start playing with chainsaws, strimmers and other toys as we set about the Church yard and car park. Join us for as much of the morning as is possible. Please let the office know if you are going to attend the breakfast.


### Walking Weekend, May 2015
![Walking in the Black Mountains 2013](/images/black_mountains.jpg) A walking and camping weekend, often in the Brecon Beacons. The format is usually a curry on the Friday night, a big walk on the Saturday and a shorter walk on the Sunday interspersed with beer and food from the pub. Walks are typically 7, 11 or 15 miles with ascent and pace for different abilities.

### Wild Camping for Kids, 2015
Wild Camping has been running for four years and is usually on a weekend near Father's Day. We trek down to the beautiful [Abbey Home Farm](http://www.theorganicfarmshop.co.uk/), 2 miles from Cirencester. Dads - bring your primary school aged children for a night in the wild.

*we're aiming for primary school aged children but slightly older or younger are welcome.*

#### 18 hours of fun
Arrive late Friday afternoon and pitch your tent while the BBQ warms up. There will be a campfire and field games before ending the evening with a midnight (more like 9 o'clock) walk. Awake to the smell of Pete's famous fry-up, more games, pack-up before heading home or through the woods to lunch at the organic farm cafe. The facilities are basic - compost loos, cold water taps, a foot pump shower (heat your own hot water).



### Torchlight Winter Walk, November 2015
The formula is simple and unchanged for seven years: on a Saturday afternoon in late November we meet on The Langel (the path running from Cogges into the town) by the bridges just before dusk for a walk along the Windrush to the Country Park as the sun sets. Return to a warm yourself with a cocoa and sausage by the campfire. It is unashamedly the stuff of childhood dreams.

We walk along the river path (and back) for about 2 miles at night. You'll need wellies, warm clothes and a torch :) You are responsible for any children that you bring. Sorry - no unaccompanied children allowed.
