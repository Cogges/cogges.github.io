### Walking Weekend, May 2015
![Walking in the Black Mountains 2013](/images/black_mountains.jpg) A walking and camping weekend, often in the Brecon Beacons. The format is usually a curry on the Friday night, a big walk on the Saturday and a shorter walk on the Sunday interspersed with beer and food from the pub. Walks are typically 7, 11 or 15 miles with ascent and pace for different abilities.


### Wild Camping for Kids, 2015
Wild Camping has been running for four years and is usually on a weekend near Father's Day. We trek down to the beautiful [Abbey Home Farm](http://www.theorganicfarmshop.co.uk/), 2 miles from Cirencester. Dads - bring your primary school aged children for a night in the wild.

*we're aiming for primary school aged children but slightly older or younger are welcome.*

#### 18 hours of fun
Arrive late Friday afternoon and pitch your tent while the BBQ warms up. There will be a campfire and field games before ending the evening with a midnight (more like 9 o'clock) walk. Awake to the smell of Pete's famous fry-up, more games, pack-up before heading home or through the woods to lunch at the organic farm cafe. The facilities are basic - compost loos, cold water taps, a foot pump shower (heat your own hot water).



### Torchlight Winter Walk, November 2015
The formula is simple and unchanged for seven years: on a Saturday afternoon in late November we meet on The Langel (the path running from Cogges into the town) by the bridges just before dusk for a walk along the Windrush to the Country Park as the sun sets. Return to a warm yourself with a cocoa and sausage by the campfire. It is unashamedly the stuff of childhood dreams.

We walk along the river path (and back) for about 2 miles at night. You'll need wellies, warm clothes and a torch :) You are responsible for any children that you bring. Sorry - no unaccompanied children allowed.
