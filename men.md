## Walking Weekend, May
![Walking in the Black Mountains 2013](/images/black_mountains.jpg) A walking and camping weekend, usually in the Brecon Beacons. The format is usually a curry on the Friday night, a big walk on the Saturday and a shorter walk on the Sunday interspersed with beer and food from the pub. Walks are typically 7, 11 or 15 miles with ascent and pace for different abilities.

Tickets £35 (inc. car fuel, campsite fees, 2x cooked breakfast and 2x lunches).



## Wild Camping for Kids, June
Wild Camping has been running for four years and is usually on a weekend near Father's Day. We trek down to the beautiful [Abbey Home Farm](http://www.theorganicfarmshop.co.uk/), 2 miles from Cirencester. Dads - bring your primary school[^f1] aged children for a night in the wild.

### 18 hours of fun
Arrive late Friday afternoon and pitch your tent while the BBQ warms up. There will be a campfire and field games before ending the evening with a midnight[^f2] walk. Awake to the smell of Pete's famous fry-up, more games, pack-up before heading home or through the woods to lunch at the organic farm cafe. The facilities are basic - compost loos, cold water taps, a foot pump shower (heat your own hot water).

Food and Camping Ticket: Adults £10, Children (under 12's) £5 (prices 2013)

[^f1]: we're aiming for primary school aged children but slightly older or younger are welcome.
[^f2]: more like 9 o'clock



## Torchlight Winter Walk, November
The formula is simple and unchanged for six years: On a Saturday afternoon in late November we meet on The Langel (the path running from Cogges into the town) by the bridges just before dusk for a walk along the Windrush to the Country Park as the sun sets. Return to a warm yourself with a cocoa and sausage by the campfire. It is unashamedly the stuff of childhood dreams.

We walk along the river path (and back) for about 2 miles at night. You'll need wellies, warm clothes and a torch :) You are responsible for any children that you bring. Sorry - no unaccompanied children allowed.

Just £1 for sausages and hot drinks (prices 2013).


## Monday Beer, 9pm

![Walking in the Black Mountains 2013](/images/beer.jpg) We meet socially every other Monday for a beer at some of the lovely pubs in and around Witney.
