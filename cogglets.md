## Who we are
Cogglets is a baby, toddler and carer group run by St Mary’s Church in Cogges. We welcome all children aged 0-5 years and their parents or carers. You will be welcomed with a fresh cup of coffee or tea, a slice of home-made cake and friendly face.  At Cogglets, our focus is on the carer. We believe that if you are well cared for, the children you are caring for will be too. 

## What we do
St Mary’s Cogglets meets on Tuesdays from 1.15pm to 2.45pm during term time only. We meet at Cogges Church Centre on Church Lane OX29 3LA.

During the session we provide:

* A cafe area for parents and carers to enjoy a drink and a piece of cake.
* Some pampering treats for carers to indulge in
* A baby play area with baby toys and books
* A range of toys for older toddlers, including an outdoor play area with ride-on toys and a slide
* A craft activity for parents/carers to do with their toddlers
* Story time while the children have their squash and biscuits
* Music time

A toddler service is held every 1st Tuesday of the month with live music, an interactive Bible story and an opportunity to receive prayer if you wish.

The cost is £1.00 per session per child.

## How we do it
* We keep a register for fire safety reasons, so please ensure that you and your children are registered as soon as you arrive.
* Each parent /carer remains responsible for their children throughout the sessions. 
* If the fire alarm rings, each parent /carer will take their children immediately to the area to front of the Church Centre.
* Parents /carers ensure their children play safely 
* In case of any accidents, we have a first aid box in the kitchen area and an ice pack in the kitchen freezer.
* We always appreciate feedback. Please let us know if you have any concerns, comments or suggestions.
