title:  "Marriage Course"
---

The Marriage Course is a very practical course giving any married couple the tools to build a strong and healthy relationship. Over a series of 7 evenings many topics are covered including 'building strong foundations,' 'resolving conflict' and 'love in action'. Each evening includes a talk and time for the couple to discuss the topic together. Coffee, tea and home-made cakes are served during the evening. The setting is relaxed and informal, there is no group discussion and privacy as a couple is always respected. For further details please contact Paul or Judith Ledden on 01993 779021.
