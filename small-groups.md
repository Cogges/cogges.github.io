We warmly invite you to join one of our small groups.

Small groups meet mid-week in the relaxed atmosphere of members' own homes. Activities include worship, Bible study, prayer for each other and the wider world, and also social events. Small groups offer an environment of friendship and trust where we can support and encourage each other in our wholehearted devotion to Jesus Christ. We try to look outwards as well as inwards as we seek to put the gospel into practice in our lives.

There are currently small groups on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday evenings, usually at 8pm, and also daytime groups on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday.

If you would like to join one of our groups, please contact Jane Harper 01993 772443.

## Monday morning

The Bible says "take to heart what is written" (Rev.13) and our small group enjoys deeper Bible study and intercessory prayer.

Weekly. Venue: Newland Mill. Leader: Gill Curwood.

## Monday evening

We are an all ladies group at present, some members of long standing and some who have recently joined us. We enjoy the opportunity to study the Bible together, often having very thoughtful and thought provoking discussions. We always end with a prayer time which is very important to the group. We also enjoy each other's company, so our social evenings are an essential feature of our group.

Weekly. Venue: Cogges Hill Road. Leader: Barbara Eaton.

## Tuesday evening

A well established group for Christians of varying levels of faith including Bible study and topical discussion. We enjoy each other's company so our social events on the 5th Tuesday of the month are also very important to us. Primarily for those living on Madley Park.

Fortnightly, 7:30pm. Venue: Madley Brook Lane. Leader: Cyril Tennant.

## Tuesday evening

We meet on Tuesday evenings from 8:00pm until 9:30pm and our Bible studies spark off lively discussions on various aspects of living a Christian life. We end with a time of prayer.

Weeks 1, 3, 4 & 5. Venue: Newland Mill. Leader: Gill Curwood.

## Tuesday evening

We are a lively, good-humoured group that meets to discover more about God through exploring the Bible and through prayer. We are not afraid to tackle difficult issues and we try to understand what God is teaching us through His word. We are on a journey of faith, learning from and supporting each other as we go.

Tuesday evenings fortnightly. Venue: Curbridge Road. Leaders: Gerald & Barbara March.

## Tuesday evening

We are a newly formed group of people who are enjoying getting to know each other and are excited about finding God's vision for our lives as individuals and as a group. We meet at 7.00pm to share supper, followed at 8.00pm by worship, Bible study and prayer.

Tuesday evenings fortnightly. Venue: Church Green. Leaders: Paul & Mari Graves.

## Thursday evening

Our principle aim is to provide a place where people can feel connected to the church at Cogges and where we can experience community, practical and spiritual support, as well as a space just to chill and be ourselves within the church family.

Weekly (except 1st week), 8pm. Venue: Waterford Lane. Leaders: Allen & Lynn Moxham.


## Thursday evening

We start at 8pm with coffee and then look either directly at a Bible passage or use some Bible study material alongside it. We also have a focus on the needs of persecuted Christians around the world. We finish with a time of prayer for each other and aim to end by 10pm.

2 or 3 times per month. Venue: varies (Burwell area). Leaders: Roger & Jean Howell.
