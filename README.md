## Cogges Events Policy
- **a limited policy for scheduling events at Cogges**
- version: 0.1
- date: 2013 01 22


###Principles
1. The Google calendar is the master record of what is happening at Cogges.
1. All events which use the church building **must** be confirmed by the Office and entered into the Google Calendar.
1. All events published or advertised in 'Update' **should** be confirmed by the Office and entered into the Google Calendar.
1. All other events are included on the Google Calendar at the discretion of the organiser.


###Assumptions
1. The event complies with other church policies (e.g. risk assessment and child protection policies)
1. The event is 'approved' (e.g. approved by the appropriate hubs / PCC / Vicar )


###Steps
1. Agree a preferred and ideally a backup date with your team
1. Check the public Google Calendar at [coggesparish.com](coggesparish.com)
1. Check that any required resources are available those dates (e.g. church centre or external resources)
1. Email office@coggesparish.com with your preferred and backup dates
	+ if appropriate include the background to the event and if you'd like your event to be published in 'Update'
1. The office will check the dates against the master calendar (the Google calendar) and against other draft events and reply back to you.
1. If you do not receive a reply within 2 working days then please follow-up with the office (don't assume your dates are OK)
1. Once Confirmed:
	+ the office will add the date to the Google Calendar
	+ you should check the online calendar [coggesparish.com](coggesparish.com)
	+ you can publish the event (don't publish before you have approval)
1. If neither date is available either repeat with new dates or contact the office to discuss.


###Adding to the Calendar
- Events that are on the church Google calendars are automatically pulled onto the website.
- Title - stick to titles less than 30 characters
- Description - limit to about 70 characters
- Location - limit to about 30 characters
- The fields are limited for space, submit your changes and check the [site](coggesparish.com/events.html) to make sure that vital information isn't getting truncated.

### Notes
1. It's ok for some events to collide, particularly if the intended audiences are different. The more background you provide the faster the response.
1. Priority will be given to events that have traditionally been held on certain dates.
