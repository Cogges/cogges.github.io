## Getting married?
If you're like most people you prepare and plan for many things in life: education, career, retirement and holidays. And most couples spend up to 250 hours planning their wedding, but very little time, if any, planning for married life. There are many things you can do to begin building a lifelong, happy marriage. Investing in your relationship before you are married will reap rewards for many years to come.

We offer 2 courses:

### The Marriage Preparation Course
A five session course set in a fantastic atmosphere. You will be served coffee, tea and home-made cake in a romantic setting while listening to practical talks that are informative and fun, played on DVD. There is never any group work and you will never be asked to share anything about your relationship with anyone other than your partner.
 
    Dates: Monday evenings, 2nd, 9th, 16th, 23rd and 30th March 2015 (limited spaces) 
    Time: TBD
    Venue: TBD
    Cost: £25 per couple

### Marriage by Design
Marriage by Design is a one day course that gives you the opportunity to take some time out to think about your future married life together. The day is led by trained facilitators, who will introduce topics and ideas, but the day itself is really for you as a couple to spend time together talking about your relationship.
 
    Dates: Sat 28th March 2015
    Time: 9.30am – 4pm
    Venue: TBD
    Cost: £35 per couple to include lunch
